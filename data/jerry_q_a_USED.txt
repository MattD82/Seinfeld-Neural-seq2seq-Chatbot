All right, all right.	Where?

You got a receipt?	I cant find the receipt.
You should get the receipt.	Look, forget about the receipt, all right?
Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?	What do you think this is a little scam I have?
Maybe you asked for it to be washed.	No!
Let me explain to you something, okay?	You shrunk it!
I dont know.	Well, it couldnt be too expensive.
What do you think, Jerry?	Im no cat killer.

I told you not to sell.	You did not tell me not to sell.
I said the market fluctuates.	Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates.

Thats probably why were staying here, because you lost money on the stock.	So, what am I looking at here?
So dont finish it.	Shes full.
I dont like to discuss figures.	How much?
I dont know, what?	So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital now?
Oh god.	Is that still from the cats?

Im not an investor.	Im always in traffic with the lane expert.
She cant kill me right?	No, of course not.
People break up all the time.	Everyday.
It just didnt work out.	You tried.
I kept looking at her face.	Did you tell her you loved her?
Oh, I had no choice.	Youre a human being.
And I didnt even ask her out.	Youre too nice a guy.
I am.	Youre flesh and blood.
I had nothing to do wtih any of this!	I told you when I met her.
My back is killing me.	You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
Oh yeah, everybodys guy is the best.	Im gonna make an appointment for you.
Please.	You should just do it like a BandAid.
Hi.	Hi.
Hello, Jerry.	Hello.
Did you get a haircut?	No, shower.
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass.	A relationship is an organism.
If I was a different person.	Hello.
Come on up.	Oh, its you again.
Taste this.	No, I just had a sandwich.
No, taste it.	I dont want cantaloupe now.
Youve never had cantaloupe like this before.	I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.
Uhhuh.	Its very good.
Good, huh?	Good.
I got it at Joes.	Uhhuh.
Fortynine cents a pound.	Its too far.
Its three blocks further.	Im not pulling a shopping cart.
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.	I dont return fruit.
Im outta there.	You did it?
I told her.	Uhhuh.
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it.	See, its never as bad as you imagine.
Uh, no, I, I dont think so.	Could you stop that smacking?
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.	Its very good cantaloupe.
Except for one small problem.	So, go get them.
Oh, no no, I cant go back there.	So forget about the books.
Well, yeah.	What do you need them for?
I dont know.	What is this obsession people have with books?
Theyre my books.	So you want me to get the books?
Well, nothing.	Well, I have a general idea what it was.
Good enough.	I dont know how this happened.
Jerry, its not my fault.	No, no.
It's standard.	Ohh!
What trying to get off the phone?	Ohhhh!
Just do it like a BandAid.	Yeah.
Yeah, doctor.	The waiting room.
The waiting room.	So, how was it?
I was in there for two minutes.	Well, its a first visit.
Whats seventyfive bucks?	You cant do that.
Why not?	Hes a doctor.
Are you feeling weird?	No, Im fine.
Nothing really happened.	Yeah, I know.
We just kissed a little.	Yeah.
Well.	Good night.
Hey.	Hey.
Hips!	Uhhuh.
You gotta come through with the hips first.	That is out there.
Joes?	No, supermarket.
Well, is it good?	Its uh okay.
See, that stinks.	Im not taking it back.
All right, Ill take it back.	I dont care about it.
Jerry, you should care.	All right.
Well?	Marlene.
Oh.	Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
I thought you were trying to get rid of her?	I was.
Does George know?	No, hed go nuts.
Yeah, no kidding.	I feel terrible.
Whoa, psychosexual.	I dont know how Im going to tell him.
Man, I dont understand people.	Its partially you, yeah.
Youre his friend.	Well, he cant kill me, right?
Youre a human being.	I mean, she called me.
Youre flesh and blood.	Im a nice guy.
Hi.	Oh, my little airplane lamp.
Unless youre married to a dictator.	Yeah.
Nope.	Well, you know what they say.
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.	Really?
Yes.	You talked to him?
Yes.	Right.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder.	You said "you little phony"?
I did.	This is amazing.
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right?	You are the Queen of Confrontation.
I dont care.	Youre kidding.
No, I dont care.	You mean that?
Absolutely.	You dont care?
No.	How could you not care?
I dont know.	I thought youd be upset.
I guess I should be, but Im not.	Am I a bad person?
Youre a fine person.	That voice.
I know.	So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
See her tonight.	All right.
Im okay.	Good.
You paid that crook?	I had to.
He didnt do anything, Jerry.	It was embarrassing to me.
Oh, I was trying to make a point.	Why dont you make a point with your own doctor?
I think I swallowed a fly!	So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?
Im sorry, Jerry.	Really?
I know, Im sorry.	Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
You sure you want to talk about this?	Of course I want to talk about it.
Well, okay.	Tuesday night?
I saw your act.	My act?
Well, to be honest, it just didnt make it for me.	I cant believe this.
I cant be with someone if I dont respect what they do.	Youre a cashier!
Look, Jerry, its just wasn't my kind of humor.	You cant go by the audience that night.
I heard the material.	I have other stuff.
I have other stuff.	Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with.
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with.	My parents live in Florida now.
Hello?	Hi.
Hi.	Would you make this thing lower!
So, howd you do?	We won.
This is your greatest moment?	Well, no.
Jerry, look at this sport jacket.	Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming.
You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today.	First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
So bring her.	I dont even know them.
How come he gets to leave?	If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving.
And its always about Jeffrey, right?	Yeah.
Hey, howd you do?	We won.
Yeah!	What is this about?
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment.	What are you doing?
Levels.	Levels?
Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture.	You drew up plans for this?
Oh, Ill be comfortable.	When do you intend to do this?
Ohh.	Youre doing this yourself?
Its a simple job.	Oh, no.
Hey, thats some big job.	I, dont see it happening.
Well, this time, this time youre wrong.	Seriously?
A big dinner with dessert.	Ill give you a year.
No no no.	Its a bet.
Its a bet.	Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
Jerry, are you listening to this?	Yeah, Uncle Leo.
So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.	Right.
No, for the walking tours.	Oh, yeah.
Thats exactly right.	Mickey Mantle?
Jerry, Jerry.	These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
Are you ready for dessert?	Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert.	Yeah, I cant eat dessert either.
I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses.	Horses?
What about ponies?	I know, I hated those kids.
I had a pony.	Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se.
When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies.	Nothing.
He was a beautiful pony!	Well, Im sure you did.
You!	No, see, we didnt have ponies.
Have your coffee, everybody.	I didnt know she had a pony.
I didnt know she had a pony.	Ill drive you to the airport.
No, were taking a cab.	I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
Hey, I agree with him.	Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry.
You know, you should give Manya a call.	Maybe I will.
Oh, well.	Really?
Goodbye, Jerry.	Take care.
Bye, Jer.	Bye, Dad.
Yeah.	So, when do I get my dinner?
Theres no dinner.	Yes, I know youre not gonna do it.
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.	Thats the bet!
Yeah, well, I could do it.	We didnt bet on if you wanted to.
And it could be done.	Well, of course it could be done!
I dont want the levels!	Thats the bet!
Who did you talk to?	Uncle Leo.
And whens the funeral?	I dont know.
She just had a checkup.	What?
What?	You dont think.
Oh, dont be ridiculous.	You dont think that I killed her?
You know what the flight backll cost us?	It was just an innocent comment!
Maybe we can get an army transport flight.	The whole thing was taking out of context.
The funerals Wednesday.	Wednesday?
What?	Ive got the softball game on Wednesday.
So?	I didnt even know the woman.
So dont go.	I mean I met her three times.
Jerry, no ones forcing you.	I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday?
What?	I dont know what to do.
You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me?	We dont understand death.
I actually like ponies.	Two FortyFive.
And what times the funeral?	Two o clock.
How long does a funeral take?	Depends on how nice the person was.
They always make me take stock of my life.	I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it.
He has to go.	Me?
Whos going to play left field?	Bender.
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel?	Fifty years they were married.
Phoenix?	I dont know.
Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning.	Well, the games starting just about now.
Youve got your degree.	I just wanted to say how sorry I was.
Jerry, you wanna hear something?	Yeah.
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.	Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.
Oh, Jeffrey.	You know Jeffery?
Its raining.	Its raining?
Who gets picked off in softball?	Its never happened to me before.
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?	Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?	I thought there were two outs.
What about Sharon Besser?	Oh, well, of course.
Makes you wonder, though, doesnt it?	Wonder about what?
You know.	You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
I never saw anyone play like that.	But I went to the funeral.
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.	Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
Not necessarily.	Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?	What is the pony?
What is the pony?	I hate clothes, okay?
The back?	Why dont they open up an entire store for the back?
Oh, I just read that.	Her father wrote that.
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay?	I guess Im coming.

So, thats why were not together anymore.	What is this?

Over three hundred?	Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
Is it over four hundred?	Would you?
Woah, Nelson!	I know, I know.
What are you gonna do with the leather one?	I dont know.
Well, are you gonna wear it?	Maybe.
Youre not going to wear this.	Do you want it?
Well, yeah.	Okay, take it.
Oh, its from Les Miserables.	You know, Schumann went mad from that.

Values are very important.	Oh, so important.
Thursdays great.	Tan pants.
Are those Cotton Dockers?	Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
Really?	You like that commercial?
Yeah, thats the one.	What could you possibly like about that?
Hey, I know guys like that.	Even if the dialogue did ring true.
Thats the idea.	But theyre talking about nothing.
Thats the point.	I know the point.
No one is telling you to like it.	I mean, all those quick shots of the pants.
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants.	Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through.
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.	No kidding.
Hi.	Youre still thinking about this?
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up.	She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
It is funny.	I like to use my own material.
All right, I gotta make a call.	Why do we have to leave?
Oh, see, this is the problem.	Youre kicking me out of my house?
Right, alright.	Dont do the apples.
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me?	Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs.
Got her machine.	What did you say?
I dont know what the hell I said.	After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
Somebody did that?	Shell call you back.
Shell call you back.	Not once.
Never?	I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
Thats amazing.	Thank you.
Is there anything else about you I should know?	Yes, Im lactose intolerant.
Really?	I have no patience for lactose.
So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.	What?
You told him how I like the commercial.	Well, so what if I said that?
Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends.	No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
Boy oh boy.	I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial.
I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.	Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
Hey.	Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.
Dont bother, Im leaving.	Donna, really, youre making too much of this.
One hundred percent Cotton Dockers.	Please, Donna.
I cant believe I said that.	Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
What happened there?	Ill tell you later.
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back.	You said that?
I lost it.	I cant blame you.
She did.	What?
She called my office.	So she didnt get the messages.
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting.	But what about the messages?
But what about the messages?	Elaines thing?
Ill meet her outside the building.	But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
Unless she goes for the bathroom.	Theres nothing to it.
You do it for me.	What?
Come on, itll be so much easier.	How you gonna get me up there?
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.	And who makes the switch?
You do.	I do.
I cant do it.	I cant get involved in this.
I think I may be in love with this woman.	What if she sees me?
Oh, you are such a wuss.	A wuss?
Yeah.	Did you call me a wuss?
Well there is traffic.	I got one problem.
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippytoe!	Tippy Toe?

All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.	What song?
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?	What is that?
Oh, its a lovely song.	Anything else?
You pick it.	Lemon Tree.
Peter, Paul and Mary.	No, Trini Lopez.
Alright ok.	Standard.
How do you feel?	Feel good.
You nervous?	Not at all.
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld.	All the time.
Its nice to meet you.	Hi.

The bathrooms on the hall to the right.	Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
No, Im fine.	Um, you know, its the damnedest thing.
Now I know who you are!	Right.
Carol, thats so rude.	Hey you two.
Dont you find that strange?	Yes.
Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up.	I love my phone machine.
I love my phone machine.	Well, I painted my apartment again.
Well, I painted my apartment again.	What did you do?
You know, I should've done this years ago.	Well, looks are so subjective.
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race.	Maybe.
No, Im not going up there.	Harold and Manny.
Im not going.	Boys, boys.
Oh, Jerry.	I slid the rent under your door, Harold.
We have to go up there now and clean the apartment.	She died?
Whats the matter with you?	Are you kidding?
Oh yeah, I like her.	Its not promised to anybody?
Whats the difference?	So, its okay?
What was that all about?	Oh, nothing important.
Whats going on?	What look?
Somethings going on here.	I dont know if you should sit for this or not.
Jumping up and down?	Oh, Elaine.
Would you please?	What would you say if I told you that.
No.	Yes.
No.	Yes.
You didnt.	I did.
You got me an apartment in the building?	I got you an apartment in the building.
How did you.	Remember Mrs.
No.	She died.
She died?	She died.
She died!	And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
Four hundred a month?	Four hundred a month.
And Ill be right upstairs?	Right upstairs.
Right above you?	Right above me.
Oh, were neighbors.	All the time.
We can exchange keys so we can come in and out.	All the time.
All the time.	The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing.
What happened to you?	You cant believe what I just did.
What?	I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it.
What did you do?	How could I have done that?
Done what?	I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building.
Elaines moving into your building?	Yes.
Right above you?	Yeah.
Youre gonna be neighbors.	I know.
Shes right above you?	Right above me.
How could you do that?	Cause Im an idiot!
Dont insult me, my friend.	Did you ever ask an exgirlfriend to move into your building?
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?	Shes right in my building!
Youre doomed.	But I need the home bed advantage.
Of course.	Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
I was just in there.	Oh, whos gonna know?
They saw me walk out.	Two minutes.
Two minutes.	My censoring system broke down.
My censor quit two years ago.	So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
Tough.	You know, the water pressures terrible in my building.
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.	If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.	Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash.
Id like to have a kid.	Yeah, the guy with the flat head.
Hes a cube.	Yeah, Ive heard that about wedding bands.
I wonder if thats really true.	That would be an interesting sociological experiment.
You cant pick up anything with these!	Boys, boys.
Your friend cant have the apartment, Jerry.	What?
Because its true!	Hey, hey.
Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, well give it to her.	Well, thats a lot of money.
What happened to you?	Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me.
Five thousand dollars?	Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
So, she cant get the apartment.	Cant get it.
So, she doesnt move in.	No move.
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?	Elaine?
Yeah.	All right, this is going to require some great acting now.
Are you kidding?	Cause you know, I love Elaine.
Of course you do.	But you know.
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit.	Well.
Oh, I know.	Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment.
Five thousand dollars?	I know.
How am I going to get five thousand dollars?	I have no idea.
Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.	Yeah, well, I didnt Is that something you want to borrow?
Loan her the money.	She doesnt wanna borrow the money.
Yeah, so whats the problem?	Who said theres a problem?
I dont know.	It was all over!
You didnt want her in the building?	No, I didnt!
Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for?	People dont turn down money.
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.	Let me explain something to you.
So, youre Elaines hero.	Yes, its my lifes work.
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today.	Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
Oh, the marathon is great, isnt it?	Oh, yes.
I wish we had a view of the finish line.	Whats to see?
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan.	Hi how are ya?
Well, Jerry, itll be nice having a close friend nearby.	Fantastic.
She can pop in whenever she wants.	I know.
She doesnt even need to knock!	Its tremendous.
Anytime of day.	Im in heaven.
So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?	Oh, I wouldnt quite say that.
Really?	Im a guy  it always looks like that.
Because, I was thinking.	Nah.
Please.	You have no idea what an idiot is.
But suddenly, a new contender has emerged.	George, I didnt sleep at all last night.
Well, its all taken care of.	What?
Elaine.	What are you talking about?
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.	You what?
Cash.	Who would pay that much?
Hes in the music business.	Elaine would never borrow that much money!
Wow.	Its just unbelievable.
They rehearse all the time?	All the time.
Im not going up.	Manny.
Oh, I love the one they do right after this one!	I dont know.
That took awhile.	Dont get up.
So how long has it been in the basement?	Since my grandfather died.
Whats in it?	Grandpa clothes, I cant wear em.
You want these?	No, go ahead.
I know someone wholl do it.	No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava.
Students cant clean.	How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
Oh my God, its exactly the same!	What?
What?	Spread out, spread out you numbskulls.
Yeah, good, good.	Inkadink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
No, no, no, no, Im It.	No, hes It.

Yea.	Arent you gonna take it?
Oh, uh, well  okay.	All right, lets go.

Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations.	All right.
And we have to get back to work.	I gotta get to the airport.
Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.	The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
Theres no Rubber Man.	Why did I think there was a Rubber Man?
Im leaving.	Where are you going?
To Ravas house.	Oh wait.
Oh wait.	Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!
Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight!	Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
But I didnt just clean your apartment.	Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Jerry?	What?
Yeah, Im coming!	I think thats the statue from my house.
What statue?	I had a statue!
You have a statue?	My grandfather gave me a statue!
Since when?	Whats the difference?
Uhh.	I cant believe it!
Do you realize what youre saying?	Yes!
Are you sure?	Pretty sure!
Maybe it just looks the same.	Coincidence?
I never saw the statue.	I had a statue!
I dont know.	Ill call Kramer.
Oh Jerry, dont blow this for me.	Dont worry.
Dont worry.	Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan.
My mother left us when I was six years old.	My moms down in Florida.
I love these pastries.	Listen, uh I just remembered.
How about dinner?	No, I dont eat dinner.
No, I dont eat dinner.	Uh huh.
Uh huh.	Nope, the cop says its my word against his.
Lets go get him.	Yeah, right.
We cant just let him get away with this.	Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this?
Let me just call him.	Ill call him.
I thought you said one oclock.	Relax, hes late.
Remember, dont take any crap.	Yeah, yeah.
Ill be right here.	Thats comforting.
Oh, Jerry.	Well, I didnt.
I wonder why.	Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything.
Give it back?	Yeah.
What are you talking about?	What are you talking about?
Im talking about the statue.	Yeah, me too.
Give it back to whom?	Me.
You?	Yeah.
You already got it.	Ray, I had a statue in my house.
What are you saying?	What am I saying?
What a mind.	Well, I.
I cant believe what Im hearing.	I cant believe what Im hearing.
Pawn shop?	A pawn shop?
Cleaning them out.	Oh, excuse me.
You want her.	No, shes a little too cheery for me.
Shes from Finland, for crying out loud.	I know Finland.
Is it me?	No, I actually find you quite charming.
Oh, I find you so charming.	Did you call me a wuss?
What did you say?	I said luss.
I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.	Thats not necessary.
Thats it!	George.
Oh, Im crazy!	George, george.
I hope you think about what youve done here today.	Hey, Ray.
Yes?	How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid?
Theres just no justice.	Really?
Well, how do you think I feel?	Cant you talk to your boss?
Good, good.	All right, all right.
Yeah.	Kramer, what did you do?
Well, Ill think of something.	People are going to steal from you.
Hey.	Hey.
Boy, I have really had it with Newman.	Well, what'd you say?
I said " Jump.	What's his problem?
No job.	He called the right guy.
Well, what am I supposed to tell him?	All right, I'm leaving.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?	Fluff and Fold.
Well, you're going over there.	I don't wanna mix in everything!
Have you ever met my guys?	No.
Well!	All right.
Ah!	Oh, beautiful.
Oh, beautiful.	This stuff on top is my friends.
I'll have to charge you for another machine.	Whatever it costs.
Guess what.	How did you know I was here?
Kramer.	I don't know.
I quit my job.	Get outta here.
You can have this on Monday.	What happened?
I snapped!	So, what are you gonna do now?
Nobody's hiring now.	So what are you gonna do?
I like sports.	Uhhuh.
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.	Yeah.
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager.	Yeah.
What about that?	Well, they tend to give those jobs to exballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
Well, that's really not fair.	I know.
Movies.	Yeah.
Do they pay people to watch movies?	Projectionists.
That's true.	But you gotta know how to work the projector.
Right.	And it's probably a union thing.
Those unions.	Talk show host.
I think I'd be good at that.	Really?
Yeah.	Well, that's where it gets tricky.
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host.	I wouldn't think so.
It's all politics.	All right.
This could have been a huge mistake.	Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
Guess not.	Maybe you can just go back.
Go back?	Yeah.
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?	Sure.
Just.	Never happened.
I was just blowin' off a little steam.	So what?
I'm emotional.	That's right.
Never happened.	Never happened.
Never happened.	To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office.
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.	Well, so that's that.
No.	That's not that?
No.	Well, if that's not that, what is that?
I've got some plans.	What kind of plans?
What's the difference?	You don't wanna tell me?
I'm gonna slip him a mickey.	What?
You don't understand.	What if you destroy him?
No.	Well, wha  what does that do?
This is what they would do in the movies!	You've really gone mental.
Nah.	Where are you gonna get this mickey?
I got a source.	You got a mickey source?
And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.	Elaine?
I told her what a sexist he is.	She knew that.
But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.	What is the point of all this?
Revenge.	Oh, the best revenge is living well.
There's no chance of that.	Did you get your laundry?
Yeah.	What's with you?
He jumped.	What?
Yeah.	Did he call you last night?
Oh, yeah.	What did you say?
I said " Wave to me when you pass my window.	Whew.
No!	Oh, my god!
What's the matter?	Well, on Thursday when I came home I had 1500 on me.
Where?	To the Laundromat.
Hey, you see that sign right there?	Oh, I see.
Yea that's right, 'cuz this place is my country and I'm the president, and that's my constitution.	So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it?
You ever hear of a bank?	Come on.
Yes!	Maybe we should call this off.
Come on.	And what's gonna happen?
Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!	If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile.
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah.	What about the gentle cycle?
What about the gentle cycle?	Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?	What about fine fabrics?
What about fine fabrics?	What about stone washing?
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it.	Yeah.
Oh.	What?
It was in my laundry.	In your laundry the whole time?
Well, what are you waiting for?	Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat.
Nah.	People like the idea of revenge.
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad.	What have I done?
No.	Johnny?
Hey, where's Kramer?	I don't know.
I think I'm having a heart attack.	I don't think that's it.
I'm not kidding.	What does that mean?
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.	Oh, he's having a heart attack.
Tightness.	C'mon.
Shortness of breath.	Oh, this is ridiculous.
Radiating waves of pain.	I know what this is.
There was nothing else on.	He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
Why can't I have a heart attack?	So what do you want?
Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.	I'll call an ambulance.
Shut up!	Well?
"Salami, salami, bologna.	"Salami salami bologna"?
Oh, your friend's fine.	What a surprise.
No, no thanks.	You know, I was wondering.
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket.	Well, you know, I was thinking  if things don't exactly work out.
Well, it wouldn't fit you.	No, I tried it on.
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all.	Well, you know.
Well, okay.	Oh, and.
Susan Davis?	Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
I don't know.	You know, if your future was a little more certain.
Okay, go ahead.	Well, ah.
Jerry!	Elaine, what are you doing here?
Jerk off.	There's nothing wrong with him.
I haven't?	Hey, that was really fun, George.
It happens.	Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
That's interesting.	Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
Oh, I'm sorry.	Women go after doctors like men go after models.
Hey.	Hey.
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs.	Kramer.
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing.	Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.
Oh man.	It's routine surgery.
Well, what should I do, Kramer?	Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do.	Eckman?
No, no, he's out.	A rebel?
Holistic.	George, you need a medical doctor.
Let me ask you something.	Well, an overnight stay in a hospital?
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?	Don't flatter yourself, my friend.
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life.	I've never had a really good pickle.
Would you not put your foot on that please?	Sorry.
No.	And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
You see, you are in disharmony.	There's some hot air blowing in here.
Could it be lukewarm?	Too much dairy?
Your tea is ready now.	I love crampbark.
Cleavers.	Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid.
And some couchgrass.	Couchgrass and crampbark?
Go ahead, drink it, George.	Excuse me, Tor.
I don't even like Chuckles!	Maybe he doesn't like them.
I want that Chuckle!	I'll get you a Chuckle.
Yeah!	You're gonna fight?
Alright!	Really, gentlemen, please.
You can't leave!	All this for a Chuckle.
What's a Chuckle?	It's a jelly candy.
Oh, poor George.	Hey, check the TV.
It's just as you prophesied.	That's it!
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick  never is.	What are you doing?
Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?	He was good in Man From Uncle.
Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?	I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
Oh, right.	No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
Been a while?	I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
I think my last time was in Rochester.	I remember that it's a good thing.
What?	What?
What was that look?	What look?
The look you just gave me.	I gave a look?
Yes.	What kind of look?
I know that look.	Then what was it?
Why should I tell you?	Well, you're the big look expert.
Trust me.	What?
What about the look?	I don't know.
You got something on your mind?	No.
Things occur to me from time to time.	Yeah, me too.
No, of course not.	I mean, it was something we did.
Thirtyseven.	Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there.
We know the terrain.	No big surprises.
Nope.	What do you think?
I don't know.	Well, it's something to consider.
Yeah.	I mean, let's say we did.
What if.	Is that like the end of the world or something?
Certainly not.	Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
I know.	I mean, really, what is the big deal?
It's almost stupid if we didn't.	It's moronic.
Absurd!	Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
Devastating.	Because this is very good.
And that would be good.	That would be good too.
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.	But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems.
Huh.	For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
Right.	But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
Well why should that be?	Beautiful.
All right, sir.	Now here's another little rule.
Yeah.	When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters.
Okay, okay.	Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
What about the kiss goodnight?	Tough one.
It's brugwa .	Fine.
Well.	You ready?
Ready.	So think you can handle this?
Hey.	Hey.
Got the paper?	Not yet.
No paper?	I haven't been out yet.
What's the deal with Aquaman?	No, I think I saw him on land a couple times.
Still lookin'.	Nothin' much.
Oxygen!	I thought you'd like that.
Oh, this is huge!	I know.
All right, okay.	No, I can't do details.
You wha?	I can't give details.
No details?	I'm not in the mood.
Where are you sitting?	On the couch.
Next to each other?	No, separated.
Time?	Around eleven.
Okay, go ahead.	So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
Oh, see?	And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
Boy, these are really bad details.	It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
Oh I hate to hear this.	Well.
Better than before?	She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
This is all too much.	Not exactly.
Where are you living?	I think we've worked out a system.
Oh, you know what you're like?	No, this is very advanced.
Sure, all right.	Okay.
So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call.	You ready for the second one?
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.	Spending the night.
No, you see?	No, that's the rule.
I know less about women than anyone in the world.	I think you're wrong.
I hope I am.	Is this yours or the roommate's?
The roommate's.	Would she mind?
She keeps track of everything.	Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
Thanks.	Well, guess I'll get going.
Oh.	Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning.
Fine, go away.	I don't understand.
Just go.	I'm having surgery tomorrow.
Oh, surgery.	But you said, it can be very serious.
Okay, so fine.	What happened to the rules?
Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.	It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
Hi, Jerry.	Hi.
What are you doing?	I can't go if you're mad.
I'm not mad.	You seemed a little mad.
No, no.	So you're okay with everything?
Definitely.	Definitely.
Goodn  What're you doing?	What?
What about jewelry?	No, no.
Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.	No, no.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?	You don't understand.
What does she need?	I think I heard her say something about a bench.
A bench?	I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
What, like at a bus stop?	I don't know.
Like a park bench?	I have no idea.
Who puts a bench in their house?	Forget the bench.
I got it.	No, too relationshippy.
Okay, what about a nice frame?	Nice looking fellow.
What about candle holders?	Too romantic.
Lingerie?	Too sexual.
Waffle maker.	Too domestic.
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.	Too Gubernatorial.
Let's work on the card.	Maybe you won't like it.
Oh, how could I not like it?	You could not like it.
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.	Of course I remembered.
Cash?	Would do you think?
You got me cash?	Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want.
Who are you, my uncle?	Well come on.
Pal?	I said, "and more.
I am not your pal.	What's wrong with pal?
That's pretty good, huh?	Great.
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it?	Well goody for you.
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that.	182 bucks.
Oh Kramer.	Could you excuse us please?
What?	We're talking.
Oh, the relationship.	You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
I know.	Never.
Ever.	We got along beautifully.
Like clams.	It was wonderful.
A pleasure.	So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
I can't do it.	You what?
I can't do that.	You mean it's.
This, that, and the other.	Oh, sure.
You.	Well.
Those birthdays.	I never should have made up those rules.
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything?	It can't be the nudity.
You know what this means?	Why?
It's break up by association.	What did you end up giving her?
91 dollars.	Sorry about that.
So what're you gonna do?	Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore.
So, maybe this should be it.	Could be it.
She seems like an it.	She's at it as you get.
We'd have to kill him.	We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.
I'd go to prison as your accomplice.	Plus, you know what else.
Hey.	Hey.
You got the paper yet?	Yeah.
Ah, this.	And the other.
She's pregnant?	She's the performance artist, right?
Yeah, performance artist.	What's her husband's name, again?
Todd.	Todd.
No, he's not.	C'mon.
By marriage.	Oh, by marriage.
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?	Thin ice, George.
Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.	You believe this guy?
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right.	he thought he still had a shot.
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else!	What ever happened with the shirt?
I don't know what I'm gonna do.	Asked you?
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.	Ask not what I can do for you  ask what you can do for me.
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment.	But?
My roommate has Lyme disease.	Lyme disease?
She has this in addition to EpsteinBarr.	How did she get Lyme disease?
I don't know.	They still do that play?
It's a classic.	With all the nudity?
Never said goodbye.	Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
What do you wanna know?	Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
Rarely.	There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
No.	When is this suppose to be?
Saturday.	Saturday?
I'll take full responsibility.	'Cause I've seen these pregnant women  and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth.
Someday, before I die, mark my words  I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her.	And if you do?
What are you doing this for?	Quiet.
But you don't have to do this!	Leave me alone.
It's a onetime fee.	I'm not getting illegal cable!
Oh, so what are you gonna do?	No, I read in the paper.
Oh, oh, the paper.	Well, they might hook us up again.
Oh, God, you're so naive!	Stop shouting!
Can you hear yourself?	What you're suggesting is illegal.
It's not illegal.	It's against the law.
Well, yeah.	Just, just, hold this.
Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over?	A real human rights nut, huh?
Yeah.	I don't know.
Oh, you're not gonna get caught.	You know, why don't we wait?
No problem.	Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off.
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk.	Put it in.
Mr.	Seinfeld.
We're with the FBI.	My cable hookup?
It's been illegally installed, Mr.	It has?
You're in serious trouble, Mr.	Wait a minute.
I'm afraid not.	What's with this airline?
No sir.	Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
Sounds like a rough trip.	Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway.
So, the college cancelled the gig?	Well, there was so much snow.
Forget it.	No, really.
It's nothing.	Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?	You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know.
What, tonight?	Yeah, yeah.
My place?	You want to get a bite?
Yeah, I would.	Well, so what should we do?
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?	Red shirt!
What are you talking about?	You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
I am?	A  Ha!
You gotta let me go over there.	What are you gonna do?
What am I going to say?	Yeah.
What did you go out with me for?	You'll never say that to her face.
What are you doing here?	The show was cancelled.
Jerry, what a surprise!	Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Jerry?	I'm sorry, I.
Mary Contardi.	Oh, I, I, think I remember.
Told me you had a great time!	Well, I'm sure I meant to call.
Liar!	No, I don't think that.
Yeah.	Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing.
You don't want?	No, I don't want.
Four hundred dollars.	Four hundred dollars?
I'll be right back.	I'm not paying four hundred dollars!
Why can't I meet a Kennedy?	Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
Cops.	I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'copgarbage man'.
You should run for mayor.	Ehh, nobody listens.
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are.	Really?
They were, it's kinda complicated.	Well what is it?
How many?	Ah, alright, four.
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.	We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
Lashbrook, 4!	So did I do a terrible thing?
You mean lying to your uncle?	I couldn't have dinner with him.
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.	Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?	Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
What?	There's a woman over there that looks really familiar.
I've never seen her before.	I know this woman.
Didja see that?	Well maybe they were here from before.
Find out what's going on!	Excuse me, didn't those people just come in?
What's your name?	Seinfeld.
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table?	Boy, you are really hungry.
If anything happens here, can I count on you?	What?
If we decide to go at it.	Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble.
I'm gonna faint.	George, who is that woman in the stripes?
I don't know her.	She looks so familiar.
What are they gonna do?	They won't do anything in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?	50 bucks.
What?	What happened?
I offered them 25, they had no idea.	George, the phone's free.
How do people fast?	I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight.
Yeah, well, he probably bought it.	So what happened with Tatiana?
I shouldn't even tell you this.	Come on.
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.	I'm with you.
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom.	This could only happen to you.
No.	Oh, boy.
Yeah.	Wow!
Jerry, talk to that guy again.	What am I gonna say?
Give him a plate and you eat here.	Excuse me.
She's not there.	Didja leave a message?
Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman.	Where do I know her?
Hello, Jerry!	Heeeeyyyy.
How is everything?	Good, good, good.
Oh, working hard.	Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing.
You haven't been around in a while.	I know, I know.
You should come by.	Definitely.
Lorraine.	I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine.
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!	Oh my god, Lorraine.
The one you broke the plans with tonight?	Yeah, she works in his office.
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with.	Just a movie?
Just a movie?	Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
Alright, OK.	In a Chinese restaurant?
It's more than the meal!	Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
Alright.	I'm counting your shrimps.
I guess it's you, Jer.	Me?
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.	The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
No no, no, I want that table.	You lost the 20.
Make it clear?	What a sorry exhibition that was.
Your name?	Seinfeld.
Yeah, Seinfeld 4!	No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
Oh yes, yes.	Well, actually, we did date for a while, but.
Relationships are difficult.	Alright, listen, alright.
So?	There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
So when are we gonna eat?	Five, ten minutes.
We should have left earlier.	I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
Oh, well I have to eat.	Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
Eat it in the cab?	We'll eat it in the movie.
Oh, who do you think you're going?	Well what do you suggest?
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.	I'm not going to 'Skyburger'.
I have to eat!	So they have hotdogs there.
She called.	Who's Cartwright?
Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.	So You're not going?
You don't need us.	Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself.
Seinfeld, 4?	Hunger will make people do amazing things.
Do you want some of mine?	Take some of mine.
Why do I get pesto?	Who said you have to like it?
Everybody likes pesto.	I don't like pesto.
Where was pesto 10 years ago?	Look at that guy.
The thing about that painting.	Oh, one more thing about the car.
That's a tough minute.	I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
Who?	Elaine is having a "houseguest.
Yes, a guy.	He's from a.
Seattle.	Everybody's moving to Seattle.
You tell him.	Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
Ed.	Who was in town on a business venture, and um.
Oooh.	So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
I'm never eating here again.	Nice going.
I said I would never eat here again.	I didn't say anything.
I didn't know he'd get fired.	He'll probably kill his family over this.
What if he's waiting for me outside?	A lot of excons become busboys.
Oh, like you really know busboys.	Oh, like you do.
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.	Camp.
It was a fat camp.	Elaine?
Yeah.	Busboys are always changing jobs.
Then why don't you try and get him another job?	I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him.
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?	No.
I'd like to apologize.	You, you're going now?
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.	Maybe the fat camp.
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.	I just don't think you should go alone.
It'll take to long.	Take the Kman.
Hey.	Hey.
It's been a week.	Kramer says it's up to the cat now.
Oh?	How do you figure?
Why was I in charge of closing the door?	Why was he in charge of closing the door?
So!	So!
Let me talk to him.	Talk  call him from your house.
Ed's downstairs.	No hello?
Got any asprin?	Guarantee?
I heard a little ping in the car last time.	There's no ping.
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.	So, you two been, uh.
No!	What's your airport route?
I spoke to a cab driver.	Oooh.
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015.	You still using that old alarm clock?
Anywhere in the city  I'll tell you the best public toilet.	Okay.
Sperry Rand Building.	Alright.
The busboy's coming?	You don't mean here?
He's coming up?	Where are you going?
I'm the one he wants!	No.
It won't for a while.	It was that fall down the stairs.
I should probably get going too.	Yeah.
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight.	EvryEvery time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best.
Excuse me?	You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
I don't know.	I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food.
Well that's how my fiveyear old eats.	You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
No.	He was at a carnival with his mother.
Oh.	Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that.
Have you seen any good movies?	Who takes care of your boy during the day?
We have a woman.	No no.
She had references.	Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable.
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable.	You know I think this is really helping.
I don't live near here, ya know!	So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
I don't like to talk during a massage.	Neither do I, but I do it for them.
Oh!	I'm in the middle of a story.
Why don't you ever go shopping?	Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
Oh, wasn't that terrible?	Yes, it was.
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.	I know it was stupid.
Really stupid.	Hey, I just said it was stupid.
What about this leftover Chinese food?	Take it.
I can't believe you said that.	Hey, would you stop it already?
So, whatd she say?	I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
I have a good masseuse you could go to.	Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist.
Physical therapy is covered by insurance?	Yeah.
You don't have to pay for the massage?	Not if you have a doctor's note.
What's the name of this physical therapist?	I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
How'd it go?	No appointments at all?
No appointments at all?	What's with you?
A.	Yes, A.
A man gave me.	Yes, a man gave you.
A man gave me.	So?
So he.	He was what?
Hehe was uh touching and rubbing.	That's a massage.
And then I took my pants off.	You took your pants off?
For my hamstring.	Oh.
He got about uh, two inches from.	Really?
I think it moved.	Moved?
It may have moved, I don't know.	I'm sure it didn't move.
It moved!	Maybe it just wanted to change positions?
No, no.	Okay, so what if it moved?
That's the sign!	That's not the test.
You think it's contact?	That's what a gym teacher once told me.
Hey.	Hey.
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts.	Joe DiMaggio?
Yeah.	No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel.
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.	I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
Yeah.	but not at Dinky.
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts.	I never said I'd do that.
What are you talking about, that's seventyfive bucks!	I don't know how I feel about it.
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?	Alright, alright.
He didn't say he can't.	I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
He doesn't feel funny.	If he does.
Do you feel funny?	He feels funny.
He knows that!	Roy, should we go?
Why should I?	What is the matter with you?
So, you want the notes?	You don't have to, really.
Nah nah, it's ok.	We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George?
We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George?	Well what about the week after?
Well what about the week after?	No appointments at all?
What?	Can I  can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize?
What?	Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.	Uh huh.
That's right.	See, now I know it's not him.
Why didn't you just call out his name?	What happened to you?
Hey, George?	Hello?
Told me what?	I told you we shouldn't do it.
He didn't say anything.	He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license.
Three notes?	Yeah, you, me and George.
You got me a note?	Yeah.
But I got my own note.	You what?
I got a note from my gynecologist.	Why'd you do that?
I didn't know you were getting me a note.	Of course I was getting you a note.
But you didn't say anything.	Neither did you, that's how he got caught.
How can you do that to your friend?	Hi Pam.
Pam, did the xray from Mrs.	Hi Roy.
Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.	I don't even know what to say.
Me neither.	I knew this would happen.
Me too.	I mean the whole thing, it's just.
Tragic.	Well it's not tragic.
No?	No, it's.
Unsettling?	Okay.
I hope you're both happy.	I'm not happy.
Me neither.	I mean I'm happy sometimes, butbut not now.
In college, maybe.	Yeah, college was fun.
Yeah.	Yeah.
Don't mind her.	Oh please, I love her.
I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.	Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.	What?
How ya doing?	Hi.
I'm sorry, Mr.	Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
I treated you, so please, just get out of the office!	Can't you just listen to me?
Run Billy!	The police?
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.	Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
They talk back.	Hey, it's the Kman.
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh.	Did he say anything?
Where?	Having a cup of coffee.
Yeah  yeah.	Wow.

Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait bang  bang  yip  yip yip See?	What causes homophobia?
Tommy C.	These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
I'm sorry.	I don't blame you.
No, blame me.	OK, I blame you.
Don't blame me.	What was I supposed to do?
It was supposed to erupt.	I find the whole thing very embarrassing.
You know what my feelings are about this.	Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
What are you doing?	Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts.
O, your being auditted?	Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent.
When was this?	Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.	Volcano?
Oh, wait a minute.	Something to drink?
What did you think, that would impress me?	You got it ALL wrong.
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?	Those brave Krakatoans East of Java.
Now you're being audited because of it.	No, that's Krama.
So, waddya' going to do?	It's all taken care of.
Why is she doing this?	I don't know.
No.	It's hell.
Now I know what I am supposed to do.	So what happened?
No.	SO?
I broke up with her.	I'm being audited!
It's OK.	Why will she still do it?
Oh, no.	How is that possible?
Because I uh, I told her the truth.	Oh, my God.
It's OK.	It's unheard of .
She asked me to.	So you lie!
I told her that she was pretentious.	Pretentious!
HUH, so should you.	OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
When I was working I spent baby.	Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars.
Pocketbook or a handbag?	Is that relevant?
Give me the phone.	What?
She never came back from lunch.	This is no good.
Hi, are you OK?	Not good.
Yeah, it's a windshield.	I can see that.
I just finished working out are you busy?	Come on up.
Can you believe somebody threw this out?	wouldn't it be invisible?
You haven't told him?	Tell me what?
I thought it was a closet.	Completely naked?
No!	OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here.
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing.	You'll sense it.
You'll sense it.	Well, what happened?
No, no she wasn't.	You didn't get my papers?
No, I didn't.	Well, where is she?
A mental institution.	Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked.
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked.	A mental institution?
She put them in her pocket book.	So what now?
I don't know.	Can we go out there?
Where?	Woodhaven.
I'm very nervous about this.	My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time .
I should be in a place like this.	That'd be great.
Why are you talking like that?	Want, want?
Uh, we're cool.	Just chatting.
What I said?	It's one stupid thing after another.
Of course I mean that.	He's never guiled.
Papers?	there are no copies.
So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?	Who makes copies?
No, lets go to the couch.	Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.
Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.	Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street?
I can't.	George?
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.	You're going by 48th St.
You're going that way anyway!	I was audited last year.
Hi Mr.	Hey, there's the old man!
So, what took you so long?	Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rentacar place.
I don't know why you had to rent a car.	What's the difference?
You could have used our car.	I don't wanna use your car.
What's wrong with our car?	Nothing.
If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.	So what would you do?
How much is a rentacar?	I don't know.
Plus the insurance.	Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
We'll pay for the car.	You're not paying for it.
Morty.	God it's so hot in here.
You don't need the air conditioner.	It's not a speech.
Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father.	Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
Ooh, you have a lake?	The lake isn't real.
Where are you going with those?	I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
We don't even sleep.	Ma.
But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.	What about you?
Why should I be comfortable?	What about him?
Jerry,  Jerry.	Na, that's not such a good idea.
Well I tought that.	Not now.
What happened?	I don't know.
What does that mean?	Well.
Why are you whispering?	Shh!
What the hell are you looking for?	I'm looking.
But how long can you look?	I'm going for the record.
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.	Oh, come on.
You remember Jack and Doris?	Nice to see you.
Scuba diving?	We're going scuba diving.
What do you have to go scuba diving for?	For fun.
So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?	I don't think so.
See?	What kind of pen is that?
This pen?	Yeah.
This is an astronaut pen.	Wow!
Oh it was a gift.	Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
Take the pen.	Oh no.
Come on, take the pen!	I can't take it.
Do me a personal favor!	No, I'm not.
Take the pen!	I cannot take it!
Take the pen!	Are you sure?
Positive!	O.
Mmm, nice to meet you.	Thanks again.
What did you take his pen for?	What he gave it to me.
Oh my God!	He offered it to me.
Because you made such a big fuss about it.	I liked it.
You shouldn't have said anything.	He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
He talks about it all the time.	If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
He didn't think you'd accpet.	Well, he was wrong.
I know his wife.	So you want me to return it?
He's not gonna return the pen.	Hey I don't even want the pen now!
Come in.	Are you O.
Why is it so hot in here?	It's only for three days.
Oh man.	Oh you wanna switch?
I am never gonna fall asleep.	Oh, no don't say that.
How can they not put the air conditioning on?	They're nuts with temperature.
This bar is right in my back!	How about that guy writing a check for 19.
I'm sweating here.	It's one day.
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard.	Stay on Biscayne.
You're going underwater?	Yes.
What do you have to go underwater for?	What's so special up here?
I told you to let us sleep in there.	Then YOU would be hunched over.
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.	You can't go?
You can go.	Without you?
Don't go.	You sure?
Maybe you should see a doctor.	We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
No, we'll stay in there.	Why don't you get a new sofa?
Nobody uses it.	I'm buying you a new sofa.
Is everybody up?	Hi.
Hello Jerry.	Evelyn, this is Elaine.
Jerry you got thin.	Too thin?
So where's the new pen?	What?
I don't know.	I never really wanted the pen.
Why you don't like the pen?	No, no, I.
Oh!	All I said was "I like the pen".
No.	Don't be alarmed.
Oh my God!	I'm O.
Your capillaries?	How are you doing?
Having a good time!	Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
What happened to your eyes?	Well I started to go under.
With the instructor?	Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask.
What happened to you?	I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
You what?	I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it.
Well I mean.	Take it.
Aah!	What is going on in this community!
I have no use for either one of them.	Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.	Well.
Say what?	You took too many of those pills.
Good.	Oh God.
Oh God.	Uncle Leo.
What's with the sunglasses?	I've got a black eye.
Hello.	Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
STELLA!	Her back hurts.
I thought Johnny was very rude to you.	No, no.
Tell them when you took my son's pen back.	Dad!
Jerry, do your act.	I can't.
They're all gonna leave.	Oh God!
Who are you?	Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
Not my Harry.	Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
Do the dog routine.	All I said was I liked the pen!
Five days?	There must be some mistake.
So we have you for five more days!	Well there's really no point in me staying.
Excuse me?	Nothing.
Good morning.	Hi Evelyn.
Five more days?	Well today's almost over.
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people?	So I'm on the plane, we left late.
Travelling, of course, is the best education.	Is he on the plane now?
Oh yes.	Uh, just my next door neighbor.
Howbout picking up their, you know.	What's the matter?
Jerry?	Huh?
Would you take care of Farfel?	Farfel?
It's his dog.	The dog?
I'm sure it's only for a day or two.	But, you know, what if, you know?
Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.	The dog?
The dog?	Let go, Farfel!
If only.	Look at this place.
Hey, when you walk him, do ya.	Do I what?
Do you pick it up?	Yes, I pick it up.
You pick it up?	Well you have to.
Oh, boy would I love to see that.	SHUT UP!
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.	No, I tried.
No, milk.	I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
What is a bender anyhow?	I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
I can't believe he hasn't called.	Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo.
Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.	Why?
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.	You're breaking up?
How come you never said anything?	Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
I tell you.	You.
Are we still going to the movies tonight?	No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
Just me and George?	Sure.
But we need you.	What do you need me for?
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friendsinlaw.	No, I can't trust him, he gets insane.
Let's go, people, let's go!	I can't go.
Can't go, Why not?	Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
I thought Kramer was watching.	He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.	No, I don't want that smell in the house.
You spritz a little Lysol on it.	No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
So we're not going?	Nah.
It,s, it's up to you.	Go ahead.
Ponce de Leon?	I want to but I can't.
Oh!	No.
It's just we want you to go.	Well, thank you very much.
Eightysix, eightyseven, eightyeight, eightynine, ninety, ninetyone.	Bad dog!
Please!	That's right, Gavin Palone.
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.	Going to the dog pound, everybody!
Do you have to?	What am I supposed to do?
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.	I'm in the book and I have a machine.
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound?	Really?
Really?	What?
Terrific.	Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?	Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know.
Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.	What are you doing?
Kramer, we like her.	Kramer?
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.	I said, "How come no one's killed her?
I said, "How come no one's killed her?	Well.
Well.	everyone knows the first breakup never takes.
Prognosis Negative!	Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.	It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
Alright, I tell you what.	I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
What does this mean?	Well, we'll go see something else tonight.
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.	She talked me into one more day.
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?	I don't know, regular human time?
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?	Why shouldn't I go here?
Yeah.	Oh yeah, urinals are fun.
I have nothing to say to anybody.	So what are calling me six times a day?
All I know about is sports.	I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
Know what?	It is?
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.	Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.	I don't know what to do.
What is this 'saving movies' thing?	I know, I know.
So, what?	It is kind of silly.
Of course it is.	I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
Exactly.	It's not like she's in the movie.
Right.	Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it?
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.	How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment?
Good.	Saving movies.
Ridiculous!	Two for Prognosis Negative.
Bell's Palsy.	You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
Kramer, are you coming?	Oh, hi Ellen.
Get in here.	Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind.
Preprediction.	Prediction.
We made plans.	Why don't we just rent a movie?
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.	No, itMac226s, it's supposed to be really bad, really bad.
Wait, George saw the movie?	You and George got together?
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.	Hello.
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.	What's up?
Well, ah you were right.	About what?
Awwwwww.	Too bad.
Hey, what are you gonna see?	Prognosis Negative.
Hey, that's supposed to be great.	It's not.
How do you know?	I have an instinct for these things.
I have an instinct for these things.	I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed.
I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed.	Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life?
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life?	Let me speak with the head librarian.
What's the problem?	This you're not goin' to believe.
Do you know how much that comes to?	It doesn't work like that.
Oh, memory burn.	I wonder what ever happened to her.
How did they ever find you?	Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books.
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books.	It's George.
You know I never got a library card.	Coming down.
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway.	I gotta go to the library.
Tryin' to save a quarter.	I kinda like those sticks.
I kinda like those sticks.	This woman's completely ignoring me.
Yes?	Yeah I called before.
Lt.	Can I speak with this Bookman?
I think I saw him.	Who?
Shhh.	Haymen, Are you sure?
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.	George got him fired.
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.	Oh, he sang like a canary.
Mr.	Not here?
He's out on a case?	Well what am I supposed to do now?
I'll have Mr.	All right Thanks.
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on.	So they forgot to get your lunch.
He purposely mispronounced my name.	I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class.
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.	I had him for Hygene.
He gave me a wedgie.	He got fired the next day.
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and .	They also have an atomic wedgie.
Boys are sick.	Well what do girls do ?
You got any coffee?	Coffee?
Yeah.	No, I don't drink coffee.
Who doesn't have instant coffee?	I don't.
You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it.	Really?
You took this book out in 1971.	Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
Yeah, '71.	Look, Mr.
You're a comedian, you make people laugh.	I try.
You think this is all a big joke, don't you?	No, I don't.
I saw you on T.	Certainly not.
I can't.	No way I'm payin' that!
Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old?	So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
I remember it like it was yesterday.	Purple?
Positive.	No Black Jack?
Uch!	Tropic of Cancer.
Rememba?	Wait a second.
Wait a second.	George, here's the book.
Where ya' going?	It was nice seeing you again.
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME!	Maybe you're getting' a raise.
George is on his way up.	Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
Remember that biography I recommended?	I'm right here.
Remember that Columbus book?	Columbus, Euro trash.
Oh, I found him.	That was double overtime.
How should I know?	Because I gave it to you.
Me?	Yeah, think.
The locker room!	Here's the book.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.	All right, I'll see you after school.
No No No!	Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
Hard feelings?	What is your problem?
What's my problem?	That is one tough monkey!
Oh?	Oh, beautiful did he like them?
No, .	Was he out there?
Na, he's gone.	I guess we'll never know.
This is what people do.	No they don't.
Well at least you accomplished something.	Big accomplishment.
What time is it?	Five o'clock.
Always late.	You're not late.
My parents.	Of course we'll hit traffic.
Isn't it going the other way?	There is no other way in New York.
But it's Saturday.	You got the picnic and burger traffic.
What's the matter?	I have to go to the bathroom.
I have to go to the bathroom.	You want me to help you with that?
No, no, I got it.	What do you think, Georgie boy?
Blueone.	I thought it was green.
There's elevators all over!	It's over there.
You come to a parking lot, you write it down.	There it is!
There it is!	Hmmm.
Didn't we come in over there?	I thought it was over there.
It's this way.	I really have to go to the bathroom.
Why?	I'll wait.
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder.	Alright.
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?	Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you.
Those school zones are a killer.	Will you let me help you with that?
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.	You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
I can tell you this.	Parents never forget a foulup.
Why are they using so many colors?	Maybe it's not on this level.
What?	There are four different levels.
It felt like a couple of levels.	You should always carry a pad and pen.
I have a pen.	Where was the bathroom in this mall?
Oh.	All right, that's it.
Jerry, look at my fish.	His eyes look a little cloudy.
Oh are they gonna be furious.	Who's got the tickets?
My fish are dying right in front of me!	No one's going to do that.
Oh that's funny?	Those are really ugly sneakers.
Sorry to have disturbed you.	It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go.
You drank a whole bottle of water.	I know.
So why don't you just go?	No I can't.
Don't you get tired of following rules?	You think I'm too cautious?
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to?	Organic.
Buddy Hackett?	He's a comedian.
I know.	All right.
You can go over here.	I can manage.
It'll take you ten seconds.	Okay, okay.
Okay, let's go.	But.
Well you're still not allowed.	Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
That's up to you.	So you don't care if I die.
What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.	It was life and death.
Uh huh.	Oh I'm lying.
I don't know.	Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die.
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die.	Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place.
Yeah, yeah.	First of all you don't even know technically that I went.
I know what you did.	Oh really, do you?
Oh really, do you?	And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity.
Yeah I'm sure.	You know this is not the first time this has happened to me.
1 No, I wouldn't.	All right, all right.
Oh your folks have an anniversary today too?	Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
Where have you been?	I was arrested for urinating.
You what?	I have uromysitisis.
Look at my fish.	No, but he's not looking good.
Elaine, shutup.	Hey, where's Kramer?
We didn't come in over there!	Where's Kramer?
Where's Kramer?	Hey George, there she is again.
So what do you want me to do?	Ask her to drive us around.
Yeah, right.	Filthy pigs.
Hi, I'm Elaine.	Jerry.
What about my fish?	Boy, those Scientologists.
What is it?	The car!
Kramer, Kramer's not here.	Kramer!
Kramer!	Kramer.
Jerry?	Yeah, over here.
She thinks I'm a nice guy.	This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened.
Why is nice bad?	What's that smell?
What, a 'little' cologne.	Manly.
Monica wants me to wear it.	So why didn't you say no?
I'm too nice.	Look at this poor guy.
She wants me to take an IQ test.	That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters.	I've never been a guinea pig.
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.	All right, I'm sorry.
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron.	Who thinks you're smart?
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.	What thing?
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!	Oh, Oh, the IQ thing.
I'm sure I have a low IQ.	What'd ya get?
What did I get or what do I say I got?	What do you say?
I say fourteen o nine .	1409, that's a good score.
Psst, You're telling me.	What did you really get?
You are my friend.	Of course.
I tell you everything, right?	I hope so.
Well, this I take to the grave.	He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese.
Why do you keep watching?	I don't know, I'm obsessed with it.
And then you flush.	Well, it's a spider.
Do you have to do that?	Bazooka Joe.
Bazooka Joe.	The buzzer.
It's your house.	My house?
It's George.	Come on up.
Casus belli.	What's that?
It's Latin.	Come on, Go in, go in!
Have you gone in there?	No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
Hey.	You know, I could probably shoot him from here.
Sure, fine.	Casus belli.
Why is what I do is so important?	Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
What's casus belli.	Oh, it's nothing.
Is it about me?	Why must you always be the focal point of attention?
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything.	This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
You'll do well, you're smart.	No see, he's not smart.
It varies.	You know, I don't even know my IQ.
145!	Get out of here!
You get out of here!	You get out of here!
Huh.	Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
No, that'd be too noisy.	Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
Hey, what do you think?	Hey, I love a good caper.
Welcome to the Dream Cafe.	Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
Oh, ah how did you hear about us?	Eh, people, people are talking.
Smoking or nonsmoking?	Ah, nonsmoking would be great.
Very good.	Thank you.
Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans.	Well, ah wwhat do you recommend my good fellow?
Oh, the turkey.	Well then the turkey it'll be.
You're very kind man.	Very kind.
Aand don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius.	Thank you Babu.
It is in deed my pleasure.	Oh, please.
Tea and toast.	Eat something!
Oh, oh very good choice.	Oh wow, so you got the test.
Hey.	Hey.
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago.	So?
Well, I'm not giving it back.	Why not?
Anyway, it's been two years.	Statute.
What?	Statute of limitations.
No, it's statue.	Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
Oh, I did scI'm terribly sorry.	Oh my God.
Please, forgive me, please.	Go ahead, I'll take care of it.
Please, I'm very sorry.	It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
You're a very kind man.	Babu, you're Pakistani, right?
Yes, Pakistani, yes.	Babu, may I say something?
But there are no Pakistani people here.	Doesn't matter.
Yes, you see everything, don't you?	Well, you know not everything.
Closed for renovation.	The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it.
Hey, do me a favor.	Of course, I always do.
Oh, he'll have to kill me.	Hey Georgie!
Coming up.	How'd you do on the IQ test?
85!	What?
85?	Well, well, well.
He's coming up?	Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous.	Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles.
You should've seen her face.	But an 85?
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.	Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.	Well, congratulations my friend.
You see how I listen.	I think it's fantastic.
You wish to eat?	Let me tell you something Babu.
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing.	Babu?
The shrimp is stringy?	Well, maybe your refrigerator.
Quiet!	No I.
You shut up!	Well I.
You make me change restaurant, but nobody come!	You know, I think I'll just take the check.
You bad man!	Bad man?
Actually, you know I think I did.	You know what it was, bad location.
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.	Aren't you cold?
hYeah.	Oh, sorry.
Hey guys.	Hey.
I just ran in to Monica.	151?
That's a good score.	So, what are you up for?
No, Chinese.	You know, what would be great?
So I took off the motor relay on the compressor.	Oh!

Yeah.	What for?
What for?	Hair?
The Chinese have done it my friend.	Done what?

Wa.	I don't know .
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!	It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
All right, All right, all, right!	Good question.
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?	If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country.
What's happening?	Tell her.
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder.	NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!
What?	The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.

Peter?	You remember Peter.
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?	Oh Elaine.

Oh!	Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.	No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.

No.	You know what that makes you?
Whooooa!	Well yes I did that's true.

Guess, what I got.	Oh!

Hello.	Yes , I got her number.
Is that Elaine?	Yeah.

Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?	She's coming up.
Elaine's coming up?	Yeah.
How often do you cut your toe nails?	I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
What?	The captain of the toes.
Jerry.	Okay.

Hello.	Hello is this Alicia?
Yeah.	This is Jerry Seinfeld.
It's George.	Come on up .

So now you're doing my bits?	I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!
Okay , all right.	Does she know?
NO!	How did it happen?
I can't say.	Well, why can't you say it?
Because I promised her.	I thought you just said she doesn't know?
She doesn't.	So how can you promise her?
Because she asked me to.	What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
All right You really want to know?	What, Elaine?
Yeah!	That was Elaine.
Well let me hear.	Wait a second.
Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!	Okay, Okay, I promise.
What's the matter?	Oooh!
Hi George.	What are you doing here?
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.	I know, George told me.
He.	Where did you come up with all that stuff?
Elaine.	George NO!
No no no no no no no.	George I'm telling ya.
I'm very attracted to you.	Aye.
Heuh.	It's early.
Where'd you meet her?	I met her on an elevator.
On an elevator?	Impossible, right?
You got less than sixty seconds.	I don't know.
Wow.	You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
Wow.	Can you believe I did that?
What crop circles?	Not a good sign.
Crop circles?	You got something in your teeth there.
What?	It's green.
Oh, man, it's spinach!	Did you bump into anybody you knew?
I had a job interview.	How'd it go?
Ok, thanks.	What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
Yeah, right.	What's the matter?
Oh, nothing.	What?
You won't think I'm a bad person?	Too late for that.
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe.	Yeah, she's got a big nose.
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.	It's a schnoz.
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.	A little.
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose?	Stop being so concerned with looks.
Stop being so concerned with looks.	Have you said anything to her about it?
I could never do that.	Alright, shut up, here they come.
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.	Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.	We have time.
It's exciting, isn't it?	It is exciting.
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but.	Please, please, Isabel?
You're not letting him win.	Then what?
He still wins but it's not a blowout.	She wants to be an actress.
She wants to be an actress.	I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number.
I'm proud of you.	So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
Good for you.	I'll tell you, the sex.
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.	It's not like that at all.
Enough.	Alright, are we ready?
Yes.	Shouldn't a doctor do it?
It looks good.	Great job.
You got butchered.	Let's put him over here.
Interesting.	Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
I don't have it, I threw it out.	You're lying!
I told you, I threw it out.	Give it to me!
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.	Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.	I was lying, give it to me!
No, you told me not to!	I want that number!
Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed.	I'm Nelson!
That's not the line, Jerry.	Alright, alright, I'm sorry.
I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you.	Well, you just need to relax.
Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.	to himself Uh oh.
Punk.	Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer!	So I assume the jig was up.
Hi!	Hey.
Elaine.	How did you get fleas?
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.	Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
That's not funny.	I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.
You know Ava's gonna be there.	Who?
The nice one that works in my office.	Nah.
I'll drive.	Oh, well, now you're talking.
It's supposed to be a good party.	What does that mean, good dip?
No, there'll be girls there.	There's girls everywhere.
There's a hundred different things here.	Got it.
You got isobutane30?	I got isobutane20.
Aha.	You got sorbitant sesquioliate?
Got it.	I have aloe!
You got aloe?	Where do they make yours?
Jersey.	White Plains.
White Plains.	Girls.
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.	Are you sure?
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.	No, let's survey first.
waving Eva.	What could possess anyone to throw a party?
Mark, is this true?	Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.	Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.
How old are you?	Thirtysix.
You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?	Yeah, yeah I did.
So what do you do?	Patting his head I'm a comedian.
Are you?	I hear a voice.
What kind of voice?	A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
How come you keep tapping your head.	It's a nervous tic.
How's it going?	Great, how about you?
I can't believe what's happening here.	How do you account for this?
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.	Well, she obviously liked you all along.
No, I would have picked up on it.	Anyway, I'm ready to go.
Now?	If not now, when?
Gimme a halfhour.	Okay, halfhour.
Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil.	Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, excuse me.	Hey, I was dying over there.
Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.	Right.
The dingo ate your baby!	You ready?
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.	I do favors.
I think something's happening here.	What?
I think she wants me to take her home.	Wow.
What should I do?	Go!
What about you and Elaine?	We'll get a ride.
Are you sure?	We'll be fine, what did she say?
She told me she wants  She told me she wants me to make love to her.	What?
Yeah.	Get out of here.
I swear.	What did you say?
I, I, I can't.	What did you say?
I.	I long for you?
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.	It's okay, that's not bad.
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating.	Really?
That's a lot of pressure.	Oh, come on.
I can't perform under pressure.	George, you're thinking too much.
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.	Pendant?
Really?	Uh, no, he's taking the car.
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?	I don't know.
You don't know?	Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
Oh great, oh, this is great.	There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
Oh look at that.	Yeah, yeah, alright.
I can't believe she's walking around in that.	Just don't make a scene.
Hey, is that real fur?	Oh boy.
Are you a vegetarian?	Here we go.
That's why we're here in America.	You're beautiful.
Call Kramer.	Alright.
No, I just live here.	Can I use your phone?
What's in it for me?	A bigger bill?
He he, go for it.	Krame?
No, not really.	I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
Call him again.	I called, what should I do?
It's two o'clock in the morning.	Oh, you got the Civil War book.
Six hundred and twenty million people died.	Thousand.
Thousand.	Yes.
No!	You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.
You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.	Oh, he's coming.
Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.	That's him.
Thanks a lot.	Thanks, great party.
I'm sorry.	Hey, it's okay.
No problem.	And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
Hey, I might take you up on that.	Here's my address and number.
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.	George, I've been sick all week.
George, I've been sick all week.	Who is it?
Mr.	Who?
Jerry, baby!	Do I know you?
See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.	Oh, okay.
You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.	You certainly are.
Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.	No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
I understand.	Look, you can hang out here if you want.
I'm not gonna steal anything.	No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
I think I can do that.	Really, I'm sorry.
Yeah.	They guy's in my house right now.
Yeah, me either.	Oh, come on.
What come on?	I've never had a job.
You know the anxiety you feel on a date?	That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend.	What are you gonna do?
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything.	Alright, I'm gonna get this.
How much is that?	Nine sixty.
Nine sixty?	Why?
Don't worry, I got it.	What do you mean, you got it?
I got it.	Since when are you treating me to medicine?
I'm not stealing it.	You're a lunatic.
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.	What do you say to a person like you?
Just walk.	Oh.
What are you gonna do?	Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
Oh Jerry!	What the hell?
Jerry, this is Patti.	Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.	What the hell is going on here?
See ya, Jerr.	Oh, Kramer huh?
I ain't leaving.	Patti?
You got anything to drink?	Alright, how much does he owe you?
Fifty dollars.	Fifty dollars.
You had Sgt.	He was a nice guy.
Oh, great guy.	Was there a redheaded guy there?
The one with the long sideburns?	Yeah.
Where does he come off?	Yeah, I know.
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.	Oh, we all hated him.
Oh, we all hated him.	Do you believe this?
Was the alarm on?	I don't know, I guess it was on.
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?	They cross the wires or something.
Cross the wires?	They stole my car.
Who did?	They did.
Was it more than just one?	What should I do, should I call the police?
What are they gonna do?	I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
Maybe you should call your car phone.	Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.	Are you serious?
Yeah, go ahead, call.	I don't even know if I remember the number.
I don't even know if I remember the number.	What do I say if he picks up?
Hello?	Hello?
I have no idea.	Can I ask you a question?
Sure.	Did you steal my car?
Yes I did.	You did?
I did.	That's my car!
I didn't know it was yours.	What are you gonna do with it?
I dunno, drive around.	Then can I have it back?
Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.	Gloves.
Jerry?	Yeah, let me ask you a question.
I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.	Sid left the keys in the car.
Jerry, when's the last time you had a tuneup?	Sid left the keys in the car.
Who's Sid?	He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
What do you mean?	He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
What, do you pay him for that?	Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
How many people does he do that for?	The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
Could anybody do that?	Hey Sid, what happened?
I'm sorry, Jerry.	You left the keys in the car?
Jerry, you got insurance, right?	Yeah, but no car.
Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a week, so I can't park it.	This Wednesday?
No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.	But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars.	Hello?
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.	Owen March, I never heard of him.
Well, he's not a baseball player.	Yeah, that's true.
Yeah.	What's that?
Can I help you?	Seinfeld.
Okay, let's see here.	Sixtysix years old?
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health.	Why do people always say that?
What do you think, would you go out with a sixtysix year old woman?	Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant.
I'm sorry, we have no midsize available at the moment.	I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.	But the reservation keeps the car here.
I know why we have reservations.	I don't think you do.
Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.	Uh, here we go.
What?	Hey Marge, you see those two people over there?
Oh, you mean like this?	Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.	Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
But we do have a compact if you would like that.	Fine.
Alright.	Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?	Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
I just don't enjoy being with him.	Well that's what's important.
Seven?	Face to face.
Seven dates is a facetoface break up?	If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit.
Whoa, whoa!	What is going on out there?
Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.	So then what?
Get out!	That's great!
Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him.	You mean a career.
Do it like this.	No.
What was wrong with that?	Oh my god.
Call an ambulance.	Boy, he took it hard.
Tell then to hurry!	It's an ambulance.
These pretzels are making me thirsty.	Kramer.
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do?	Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
What's an extremity?	You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
Okay, what about a cold compress?	I don't have a washcloth.
Well use a paper towel.	You can't put a paper towel on his head.
What about a big sponge?	How you gonna hold it on there?
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.	Should we walk him around?
Yeah, I've seen them do that.	No, no that's for a drug overdose.
He is not a drug addict!	Hey, you know what?
How's he gonna chew it?	We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.	Cookies don't liquefy.
Alright I'll get a blender.	What blender?
You got a blender.	I would know if I had a blender.
Where is the ambulance?	Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirtyfive minutes ago.
I can't believe what's going on out here.	This is an emergency, what's taking so long?
Paramedics.	Come on up.
He seems to be breathing.	Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty goodlooking guy.
I know.	Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
Almost.	Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
It's not an easy thing to bring up.	Yeah, that's true.
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.	Yeah?
He does, how'd you know that?	I could tell.
Oh man.	What happened to the car?
What happened?	We don't know!
You're not supposed to do that.	So how'd you hit the car?
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.	It's not even my car, it's a rental.
Then how'd all those cars get damaged?	Can I get anybody anything?
Hey, you seen the paper yet?	Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
Oh lord.	The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block.
Five seconds.	Can he communicate?
Yeah, well, he nods.	Alright, she's free.
So listen, what should I do?	What community?
Of course there's a community.	All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixtysix dollars.	Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so.
Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.	Uh huh, what's that?
You're not covered for other drivers.	Other drivers?
Um hm.	Your whole business is based on other drivers.
Mr.	These pretzels are making me thirsty.
Can you die from an odor?	An overdose of odor?
No no no no, I was just down on the fortysecond street subway today, it is disgusting.	Ahh.
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered.	Let me get that.
No no no, I got it.	Please.
No come on, let me, let me.	Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.	What are you doing here?
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody.	Aw, wait a.
Aw, wait a.	I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work.
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work.	Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
Like you do.	Well what do you think?
What do you think?	I don't know.
Why did France give that to us anyway?	It was a gift.
So countries just exchange gifts like that?	If they like each other.
There's Elaine.	See that guy he's talking with?
Really?	Yeah.
Who am I going to tell?	You don't.
Really?	Yeah.
"Off the wagon"?	I think it's off the wagon.
Jerry, George, what are you doing here?	What am I doing here?
gasp My god!	Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
Where did you find it?	Under the sofa cushion.
And you stopped by just to give it to me?	It's your Christmas present.
Hi nice to meet you.	"The guy?
My boss told me to find someone.	Cranberry juice?
So.	So.
I've got new for you.	Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
Where's my drink?	There.
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.	Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
Dick?	I didn't know you meant hold it, I thought you meant hold it.
Told you.	I never feel comfortable in the women's department.
Do I really have to buy her something?	Hey the woman got you a job.
What is that?	Yeah.
Who doesn't like cashmere?	Look at this.
Oh yeah.	Oh it's damaged.
You think she would care about the red dot?	It's hard to say.
I don't even think she'd notice it.	Well I can see it.
Yeah, but you know where it is.	Well what do you want me to do?
Pretend you didn't know it was there.	It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
Well just take an overview.	You want me to take an overview?
Please.	I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something.
I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something.	Yeah so?
He's acting very strangely.	Oh boy, can you smell it?
No.	Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
You don't always smell someone from a drink.	Yes you do.
What about one drink?	Yes you would.
Yes you would.	I'll prove it.
Okay.	Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
Okay, well what am I drinking?	I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me.
All right.	I don't smell anything.
Maybe we're too close to the bottle.	Yeah.
It's George.	Come on up.
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous.	Kramer.
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?	I tried to stop him.
What red dot?	Uh, I don't know.
What don't you know?	I don't know.
Well do you see it or don't you?	Ahem.
Do you see it or don't you?	Do I see it.
Do I see it.	Now what did you ask me again.
Hello.	You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk?
Hennigans.	Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
Why is that?	It's a woman in your room.
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh.	Convulsing?
Convulsing?	I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.	You don't drink.
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.	So you started drinking.
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.	Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
You knew he was an alcoholic.	What are you saying?
I'm not saying anything.	You're saying something.
What could I be saying?	Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
If I was saying something I would have said it.	Well why don't you say it?
I said it.	What did you say?
Nothing.	Yeah?
It's George.	Come on up.
Hey, let me ask you something something.	No I didn't.
Yes you did, yes you did.	I didn't have an expression.
I have to talk to Elaine.	Elaine is in the bathroom.
Did you tell her anything?	No.
Do you swear?	I'm not swearing.
Oh you told her didn't you.	No.
You told her?	I didn't tell her you stupid idiot.
Oooooh.	Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen.
It's off the wagon.	In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
I don't know.	On the wagon.
You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.	They had smooth trails.
What the hell do you know about wagons?	I know enough not to get on them.
Kissing is not sex.	George?
No.	George?
What are you doing here?	I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?	I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.	Nice try.
Ow, ow move over.	Get off of me.
What's this?	But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic.
You mean on the wagon.	Don't get smart.
Why not?	That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
All right, I'm gonna go.	What time is the lesbian wedding?
What, was that not politically correct?	I'm so tired.
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.	Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
Yeah.	Why do I always pay?
That guy is not blind.	So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me?
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.	Not only that they found it.
That's amazing.	So what do you say?
What are you?	All right, biff.
I can't.	Kramer, bumpercars?
I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble.	Could be years before I get back to Coney Island.
What did I just say?	OK.
Naked, dressed.	You oughta' sit here.
You got something against naked body?	I got something against yours.
Who's got time for squat thrusts?	All right, how about skipping breakfast.
I like a good breakfast.	I understand, I like good breakfast.
I'm not ashamed of my body.	That's your problem, you should be.
That's your problem, you should be.	Don't get up, please, allow me.
They still have no pitching.	I'm not worried about their best pitching.
No hitting?	Defence?
Speed?	Franco's no good?
They got Franco!	But you gotta like their chances.
I LUV their chances.	Tell you what.
I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years.	First we ride the cyclone.
Chilly out.	Aah, French fries.
Freeze, Police!	No, I never got the car.
Too bad.	You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's.
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's.	You want him?
Get that out of my face.	So, you missed the wedding.
George?	Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
You have my sparekey in your apartment, right?	Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.	Come on, I'll go with you.
We did a crossword puzzle together, in bed.	Were you talking?
I was telling you about Noel.	Oh, Noel!
Heh heh heh.	All right, I'm sorry.
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?	I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
How do I get the hand?	We all want the hand.
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School.	Yeah, that sounds like somethin'.
With all due respect, I don't think so.	That smells good, what is that?
The beach!	The beach?
I just joined the Polar Bear Club.	You joined the Polar Bears?
Well, it's these people they go swimmin' in the winter.	Yeah.
Yeah.	What is that, a Pez dispenser?
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?	You don't know?
No, III know.	You think they have fleas there, don't you?
No.	Yes you do, Biff.
I don't know how anyone does this.	They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
No, we would have heard it.	What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay?	I resent that you said that!
I resent that you said that!	Is this okay?
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?	I dunno, it was an impulse.
What kind of a sick impulse does that?	How could I know she would start to laugh?
I'm sorry.	Can we just go in already?
Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.	What about?
Hey, hey!	I know, but I'm distracted now.
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.	Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club.
Uh, can we cut to the chase?	"Cut to the chase"?
Yeah.	What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
A lot of people say it.	I would lose that.
What's that?	"Lose that"?
Anyway .	Really, an intervention .
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.	Me?
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.	Y'know these things are really hard to load.
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, .	You play a Hell of a piano.
Well then, what was she laughing at?	Pez?
Me, uh, uh, no, .	Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway.
What?	A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team.
So?	What happened?
Shut up!	All the comedians were happy.
Whar about Kramer?	He's the same!
He's the same!	Are you sure you want me John.
Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?	Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him.
Can I get in on that?	What do you think?
Well, I knew him as well as she did.	Yeah, but John invited her.
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?	No, intervene, go intervene all you want.
You know I got a great idea for a cologne.	Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach.
Tell me about it!	Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein.
Well it's over.	She broke up with you?
No, but I can tell she's going to.	What was on the list?
Anyway there was all this tension.	What's wrong with lunch?
You break up with her.	A preemptive breakup.
Are there any ice cubes?	In the freezer.
I looked.	Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
What's the plan?	Do I have to talk?
Hey.	Hey.
Is this the interference?	Intervention.
An intervention?	There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
Hide!	It's NOT a surprise party!
We just came from Chadway's What's going on.	We're having the intervention for Richie.
Oh, right, right, the intervention.	Well, uh.
You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?	I didn't know she would laugh.
So what's going on?	It was pretty ugly from the get go.
Ah ah Pez dispenser.	He picks it up  he stares at it  It's like he's hypnotized by it.
Well they're hard to load.	Tell me something I don't know.
Poor kid.	So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
What did you do?	What do you think?
What's a three letter word for candy?	I can't do those things.
I can't do those things.	Let me ask you a question.
Na.	What are you doing?
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?	Yeah.
Its George.	Come on up.
I dont know.	I think Ill take out the garbage.
Hey, have you ever fasted?	Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough.
Yeah, right.	Come on, its just down the hall.
Give me two bucks.	Ill give you 50 cents.
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.	Come on.
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents.	I dont get you.
Its an incredible deal.	Nah, I dont go for these nonrefundable deals.
Hi.	Hi.
How are you?	Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.	How much do they cost?
No, no the full size.	No, no the junior.
I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.	Really?
Good enough.	Boy shes sexy isnt she?
Boy shes sexy isnt she?	Do you believe that guy?
Oh, that creepy guy?	Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
hey, you know what?	Whats so amazing?
I havent seen him for months.	What was the dream?
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine.	I think Ive played there.
Id love to go.	Psychics, vacations.
I just got fired.	Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.	I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
Really?	Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.	Who is it?
Its Gina.	Who?
Martines girl friend.	Martine?
You next door neighbour.	Oh, Martin!
Its Martine.	What?
Come on.	In my pajamas?
We dont have enough time.	Itll take two seconds.
There is no time.	We dont have two seconds?
All right.	Nah, forget it.
No, go ahead.	Nah.
Will you just get it.	Are you sure?
Forget it.	Nah, Ill go get the robe.
Nah, Ill go get the robe.	Thats not too bad.
You know why he did this?	Really?
I could not stand it another minute.	Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
He does not like you.	He said that?
He was screaming about it all night.	Im sorry if I caused any trouble.
I wasnt.	You werent?
No, I have thought about you many times.	Of course.
Tell me everything.	Are you sure he cant hear anything?
I wish he was not in a coma.	I, would, I would wait on that.
I saw you looking at your watch.	No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
Are you afraid of him?	No.
Then kiss me.	Here?
Yes, right here.	Is this the proper venue?
You dont want to?	No, no, I want to.
Then kiss me right in front of him.	I cant.
A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him?	A man who respects a good comma.
Hey.	Hey.
Did you hear about Martin?	Yeah, I heard.
Hes got my vacuum cleaner.	Who told you about Martin?
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.	Hey, let me ask you something.
What, Gina?	You know I dont get that whole suicide machine.
So whats going on between you and Gina?	Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
Uh, uh.	So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women.	Nothing.
Ah, what kind of a man are you?	I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
There is no coma etiquette.	So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs.
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it.	So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma.
It is too small for someone with such a big mouth .	No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
Who are these Stooges you speak of?	Theyre a comedy team.
Tell me about them.	Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
You will show me The Stooges?	I will show you The Stooges.
Youre still afraid.	Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?	Yeah, all right.
Hello Gina.	Hello Newman.
Hello Newman.	Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up?
Did you see that wall move?	Boy, its a good thing we came.
Well call you.	George, I want you to promise me something.
How come?	Looters.
How do we know that dog food is any good?	Shes really hungry.
I wouldnt set foot in your house.	Hello.
Hello Jerry.	Hows he doing?
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.	Why wouldnt he?
No reason.	Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Ill bring him up to date.	How up to date?
Oh, all the way up.	And nothing could change your mind?
Wow, where did you get that?	From my house.
Boy, thats the full size.	Thats your big boy.
Can I have a bite?	I dont give out bites.
Just one bite?	I dont think so.
All right!	You swear?
I swear.	On your mothers life?
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.	Elaine!
I want my vacuum cleaner!	Hey!
It was disgusting.	What are you doing?
I never assisted in a birth before.	What did she name the kid?
Hey.	Hey.
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.	osh.
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.	Woah.
We played Backgammon in the nude.	Oh!
Shes a sweet kid.	Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
Whats this?	Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
They moved in together?	Yeah, its some place down in the village.
Phew.	Yeah.
Its Elaine.	All right were coming down.
Hey, where ya going?	Were taking Elaine to dinner.
Why even try anymore?	Oh, yes you will.
No, I won't.	Yeah, maybe you won't.
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.	Are my nostrils getting bigger?
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone.	Oh, so there's still hope.
I don't want hope.	Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
Um, order me a piece of cake.	Look at my hands.
So what'd you do last night?	Went out with George, you?
Went out with Cynthia.	How was it?
Well, you know, the usual The Federal Reserve, the rainforest.	We brushed on that.
I know, Cynthia too.	George too.
Yeah, right.	I've never fixed anybody up.
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.	Well why wouldn't you start with George?
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?	Well you implied it.
I didn't say it.	Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong.
Who is he?	He's George!
She's Cynthia!	So what?
What, you don't think she's beautiful?	I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
You know what your problem is?	I went out with you.
That's because my standards are too low.	Well let me tell you something about George.
He can really do that?	Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
What, are you into this?	Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.	Naturally.
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?	Everything.
Out of the question.	Why?
No!	She's good looking.
How good looking?	Very good looking.
Really good looking?	Really very good looking.
Would you take her out?	Yes, I would take her out.
Oh, you hesitated.	What hesitate?
No, something's off here, you hesitated.	I'm telling you, she's good looking.
What about the body, what kind of body?	Good body, nice body.
How nice?	Nice.
Just nice?	Pretty nice.
Really good?	Really very nice and good.
What about personality?	Good personality.
Smarter than me?	How could she be smarter than you?
What kind of hair?	You know, long dark hair.
Flowing?	Flowing?
Is it flowing?	'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
Yeah, that's right.	Just clarifying.
Let me ask you this.	Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
I'd like to be able to get it out.	I think you'll get it out.
What about the skin?	She's got a fine cheek.
Is there a pinkish hue?	A pinkish hue?
Yes, a rosy glow.	There's a hue.
Who cares about eyebrows?	I don't think you'll throw up.
We had an incredible phone conversation.	I think it's tamber.
Why'd I think it was timbre?	I didn't notice the voice.
It's mellifluous!	So, Saturday night.
What?	She could have mentioned the conversation.
Hey.	Hey.
You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?	Oh, the guy from Jersey?
Oh, well.	No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
I'll take one.	So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
I think they went out to dinner.	Wait, I got another call.
Yeah, it's me, I just got home.	Oh, hold on.
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.	Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
Remember our pact.	Of course.
It's in the vault?	I'm locking the vault.
We had sex.	Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
I don't know.	At your apartment?

We should take his limo.	Yeah, right.
Wait a second.	He's definitely in Chicago.
Well the guy's just standing there.	How would we do it?
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien.	Maybe he knows O'Brien?
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign.	What if we get caught?
What's gonna happen?	Who's gonna be O'Brien?
I'll be O'Brien.	Who am I?
You're you.	Just me?
Yeah.	Okay.

Where are we going?	Maybe it's a shortcut.
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.	'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
Right.	It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
It was a good jig.	It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig.
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.	First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
Well you should have been O'Brien.	I don't want to be Murphy anymore do I still have to be Murphy?
Yes, you have to be Murphy.	It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.

Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.	He tends to exaggerate.
Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy.	Well you might as well look it over.
Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire.	Nice looking Lugar.
The head of the Aryan Union O'Brien.	What's taking him so long out there?
Didja see the way she was looking at me?	She's a Nazi, George.
I know, I know.	Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
I don't know.	Let's just make a run for it.
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.	How'd that happen?
I hurt it in a hotel room.	I know, why do they make that bed so tight?
Okay, what are we gonna do?	I don't know.
Alright, how's this?	Nah.
And you really don't look like a Murphy.	I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
Where are you from?	Dublin.
Sounds more like Scottish.	We were right on the border.
What do I do?	Get in the car!
Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?	No, he was talking to me, he's crosseyed.
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?	It's safer!
It's safer!	Oh look at this guy.
What's goin' on?	Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission.
Did you get a thank you wave?	No, nothing.
No, nothing.	Give me that wave!
Jerry, are you free on Friday?	Yeah, I'm free, why?
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.	Oh my God!
You gotta follow that car!	What?
You can't let him get away with that!	Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
What are you, yellow?	I'm not yella.
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.	Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
Boy!	You know, I really liked her.
You know, I really liked her.	He, he, he.

So you didn't turn her in?	I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
Gonna see her again?	Friday night.
Friday night.	Yep.
It's me!	Come on up.
Come on up.	By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
Hey, hey, hey!	Oh, you dig?
Yes!	Why?
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met.	I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
I don't think so.	Look, she slammed into a parked car!
Look, she slammed into a parked car!	On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again?
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again?	What am I drinking, milk?

So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy!	So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary.
Tell her about the shoving.	What?
What shoving?	Oh, it was nothing.
No!	Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car.
You know karate?	I know a little.
Well, this is so, amazing to me!	He backed off.
Did you tell Kramer?	Ah, nah!
They should be sent to Australia.	Australia?
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.	But not anymore.
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?	Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
But last night you said you were free!	We just met.
But I, I can't go alone!	Ask George to go with you.
You'll pay?	Why do you even need anybody?
You know who's a good actor?	Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor.
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?	Excellent film.
Well I'm not taking your side!	Kirk Douglas.
I said 'God bless you'.	The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'?
It's me.	Come on up.
Yes, yes, I definitely waited.	No argument.
Hi!	Hi.
What does it mean anyway?	A stupid what?

Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.	Scarf?
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.	What's the matter?
I think I hit my head again!	What is wrong?
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.	Get together?
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.	Yeah.
Hey, you know who owns that car?	What car?
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.	Yeah who?
That blond across the street.	The blond with the blue sweatpants!
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?	The blond with the blue sweatpants!
Well, who is she?	I've had a crush on this woman for year!
Oh right, right!	Oh yeah.
You can't compromise your principles!	How am I going to live with myself?
Can't live!	I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
I believe strongly in that as you know.	There should be more people like us.
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.	You're telling me.
Well God bless you.	Thank you very much.
I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!	Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!	Well I think I get the gist of it.
So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!	What car?
Good.	It's not complicated.
Well, well, well, Mr.	Alright Elaine.

How could you?	What?
Man!	What did I do?
I don't even want to look at you anymore!	I didn't do it!
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?	No, never.
Alright.	You got a date with Becky Gelke?
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.	Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
Button fly!	I like the button fly.

Nothing.	I have to go meet Nina.
I dont get art.	Theres nothing to get.
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.	She does a lot of abstract stuff.
What for?	She sees something in him.
You know, I'm a little nervous.	Why?
Well, you know.	I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Really?	I do.

I know!	How you feeling?
I cannot believe this!	There's George!
She was a guest of my father's.	It's preposterous!
Jerry and Nina again.	Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting.
Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!	Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
Fivehundred dollars?	That's what she told me!
I'm not paying 500 for this!	That's what it costs!
Why did you even take it?	I wasn't thinking!
You weren't thinking.	Well, she framed it and everything.
Well, I'm not buying it.	Do you want me to paint you something?
Hi, Mike.	Wow, a letter from Nina!
Whoa, man!	Oh my god!
What?	This is amazing, you can't believe this!
She's deep.	".
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!	No one's ever written me a letter like this.

Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.	You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
What happened to the car?	If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.	You have to know, you must know.

Ah, George, alright.	George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?
Alright.	Huh?
Huh.	Will you stop it already?
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?	I don't know!
What, they don't like me?	I don't like you!
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine.	Why not?
Because I'm like ice, buddy.	Yep.
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit.	No, I like Mike.
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.	Oh yeah?

Why is that?	Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
Beg me.	Please, don't make me beg.
No no no, I want you to beg me.	Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
No no no, that's no good.	Kramer!
Look, I can't say anything.	Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
Alright.	I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
He thinks you're a phony.	He what?
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.	A phony?
A big phone.	Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?

Okay.	He is?
Oh, he is fantastic!	A gun?
I think it was a gun.	My god, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright.	Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
Exactly.	Where's George now?

Look out the window, you'll see.	Hey Georgie!
Hey!	Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.	Crazy kids, huh?

You're looking tremendous.	Yeah, twentyfive percent bran flakes.
I go in front first all the time.	Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
Oh great.	I didn't know.
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.	I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
Judgement, Jerry, judgement!	You're right.
What was wrong with that sorry?	It was a soso sorry.
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right?	Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
Yeah.	Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
I learned a lot about myself.	What did you do to my car?
Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.	I thought you said you were a good driver!
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.	I think you said driver.
Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.	Hey Sid.
Why don't you start taking the bus?	Okay, George.
Don't do it!	What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
You're not my father.	Hey Matthew.
Hi Jerry.	How ya doing?
Okay.	Hey, how's your father?
What?	Oh no, nothing.
What's happened to daddy?	No, no, no, no.
We're not going to have any money?	No, of course not, of course not!
I thought she was pregnant.	Hey, do you think I'm phony?
What?	Mike thinks I'm a phony.
He thinks you're a phony?	Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
Oh, you have to say something.	I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
You gotta open the vault.	Open my vault?
Open your vault.	Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
You have no choice.	Oy gavault.
Alright, just keep the hat!	Alright, that's it.
Well I'm going.	Well if he's going then I'm not going.
But it's your house.	I still don't have to go.
Why won't you go if I go?	Why?
No.	Like you didn't call me a phony?
What?	Use it in a sentence.
He begged you?	Alright, come on.
What the hell.	Kramer, what are you doing here!
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay.	You scared me!
It's just me.	That's enough!
C'mon.	Kramer!
What does it look like I'm doing?	Get out!
Alright, alright.	C'mon!
Sorry.	Move it!
I'm from Witchita, so.	Oh.
Hurry, Jerry!	The murderers!
That was close!	Did you see the look on that guy's face?
You were so fast with those keys.	Kramer!
Hey, Jerry!	All right, that's it.
What?	What, you know what, the keys.
Oh, come on!	No, come on!
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!	It was sold out!
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?	That's the point.
What point?	Just, look, just give the keys.
Just give me another chance!	Don't ask me!
I'm asking you!	I'm telling you.
You're joking.	I'm serious!
It's not going to happen again!	Yes it will, now give me those keys!
O.	So put 'em in a safe place.
I will.	Where?
I don't know.	I think so.
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.	I can't.
Is that Kramer?	Who's there?
Jerry, give him the keys back.	Elaine.
I don't want the keys back!	Take the keys.
I don't want the keys!	O.
Now, one more thing  I would like my keys back.	Your spare set?
That's right.	You want 'em back?
Yeah, O.	Did you bring the keys?
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.	This could be an emergency!
You never should have taken away his keys!	I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em.
How'd the Mets do?	They lost.
They lost.	Kramer?
Hello, boys.	Hello, Newman.
You lookin' for someone?	Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
Yeah, coy.	You're being coy.
Who?	Listen, Tiny.
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld.	Turn around, George.
George?	Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way?
Help!	Where's Kramer?
No we're not.	We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
You wanna know what happened to Kramer?	Bad rap?
Yeah.	Me?
You heard me.	L.
L.	I never should have taken his keys away.
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.	Huh?
What.	No, what'd you say?
Nothing.	Oh, you didn't see it.
Yeah, I saw it.	I heard you say something, there.
I didn't say anything.	I'm calling Kramer's mother.
Ask her about Kramer.	She's drunk out of her mind.
Look, I gotta tell ya.	Don't feel right?
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's.	What is the big deal?
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment.	First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys.
Nope, no can do.	George, give them to me, I want these keys.
Do you wanna fight?	Do you wanna fight?
Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us.	Don't you see?
You're right, how did I miss that?	What's that?
Nothing.	I heard something.
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!	Well, this is great.
Well, what do they look like?	They look like keys, George.
Well, they're obviously not here.	Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
What?	By Elaine Benes?
What?	Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
Lemme see this.	Wait a second!
Gimme half!	All right, here!
You weasels!	What?
We hardly read anything!	It was funny!
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things?	Well.
Well, it's just a first draft!	I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
He forced me to!	I did not!
You!	Elaine, wait!
Here!	Good!
Good!	Good!
I just thought I could write it.	Is that something you want to do?
I don't know.	Elaine, let me tell you something about show business.
O.	What did you say?
I didn't say anything.	I heard something.
Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!	Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?	Yeah.
Are you sure?	Yeah.
Murphy Brown, the TV show.	C'mon, will ya?
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?	Something, isn't it?
With Candace Bergen!	I know!
I've always liked her.	Sure.
Did she show her breasts in that?	She's not really the naked type.
I can't believe I missed Kramer.	He did?
Yeah, I turned him down.	How come you didn't tell me?
He asked me to keep it a secret.	But you can never keep a secret.
I know.	Well, you've come a long way.
A free ticket?	Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer.
What about accommodations?	All taken care of.
I was engaged to Mickey Rooney!	What is this?
What?	We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
I happen to dress based on mood.	Oh.
Seemingly.	And what mood is this.
I don't know, but I don't like it.	Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar.
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things.	Just go.
Are you sure you don't have any metal on you?	Anklets?
A lot of men wear anklets.	Really?
Step over here please.	Over here?
Spread your arms and legs please.	Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
Alright, go ahead.	That's it?
That's it.	Alright.
C'mon Jerry, let's go.	I must have iron rich blood.
Lala Land.	Who said that?
I called it.	Oh no.
Alright, excuse me.	Yeah, Kramer.
Curly.	Wavy.
What'd you ask me for?	Yeah, I'll hold on.
Hey, a shoe buffing machine!	I don't know, 63, George, how tall is Kramer?
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion!	About 63.
Ooh, a shower cap!	Coming.
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?	Excuse me, what?
You want your blankets tucked in?	What blankets?
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.	I don't know, whatever they do.
I tuck in?	Tuck in, tuck in.
Yeah.	Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a notuck.
Two notucks.	Uh, hang on a second, You know what?
You just said you weren't tucking.	I'm tucking!
Oh, yes, yes.	Oh, okay, thanks.
Byebye.	I can't believe she threw that out.
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.	They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
Hey, hey, hey!	Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
You shouldn't have tucked.	I like it tucked.
This is very exciting!	I don't know.
Might meet a celebrity.	I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
What are you worried about, you know it.	You gonna be alright here?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go.	Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!	How's it going?
Great!	Really?
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know?	You got toilet paper on your heel there.
Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB.	I was terrible.
What are you, crazy?	Nah, did you hear the end?
Conveyor belt.	Yeah.
I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?	Yes, Lupe.
He's on the lamb, he's on the loose!	Would you let go of my arm?
What are we supposed to do?	Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
Hope he's not the guy.	Couldn't be the guy.
God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.	How can you think of food at the time like this?
Time like what?	I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime!	You should've had some eggs.
For lunch?	Have you ever heard of egg salad?
Why didn't you say something then?	I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
I need food, Jerry.	I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
Pay phone in L.	I don't have any change.
No, I don't have any change.	Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
I have a ten.	So, break it.
I hate asking for change.	So, buy something.
What?	I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.
Breath problem?	No, I just want some change.
Tell me.	Your breath is fine.
You know, I haven't eaten anything.	I just wanna call the police!
Why don't you just call 911?	But is this an emergency?
Of course it is.	How is this an emergency?
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer.	All right, I'll call 911.
What's the matter with you?	Oh, don't be a baby!
What am I scared of?	Your name is a good name, Costanza.
Really?	Sure.
You think so?	Oh yeah.
I don't know.	We don't know.
Earth.	Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police!
You don't know.	George, it says it here on the phone.
Black and white?	A cop car.
Why didn't you just say that?	I thought it sounded kind of cool.
Oh yeah, real cool.	Oh, you are?
I'll bet you, how much?	Her tip.
You've got a bet.	Ok.
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.	Hey, get out of here.
He started it.	I did not.
I don't think so.	But you could?
Hey, can I flip on the siren?	Why are you bothering them for?
Wohoo, check it out.	Can I try it?
Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.	Scared the hell out of that guy.
You know what I never understood?	Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know.
I'm dizzy.	Nice shotgun.
Thanks.	Clean as a whistle.
You could eat of that shotgun.	What is that, a 12 gauge?
Yeah.	12 gauge.
My favorite.	Mine too, love the 12 gauge.
Looks like a possible 519.	519?
Looks like it.	I can't believe this.
All right, let's pull over and check it out.	Pull over?
What are you doing?	Pull over?
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.	We have an appointment!
What are you doing?	Great.
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.	Which flavor?
Milano.	Cops eating Milanos.
Should I take some?	I think that's a 519.
I'm starving.	They're busting this guy.
They're cuffing him.	I can't believe this.
Hi.	Hi, I'm Jerry.
Nothing.	Nothing.
Shut up.	Hot out.
I don't know, five bucks a night.	No, a dollar, two tops.
Narks?	Imagine, us narks?
Oh, thank you.	Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
Yeah well, we don't think.	We're pretty sure.
A dollar a night?	Yeah, that's a good tip!
That stinks!	I read it in Ann Landers.
That's smog strangler.	Kramer.
Got him.	I wanna see what's happening.
Hey, how are you doing?	We're doing fine.
Yeah, a player.	Kramer, do you realize what's going on here?
What?	Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
So?	Well, yeah.
What?	What happened?
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.	Really?
You're kidding?	While you were in jail.
Yes, I'm free.	So Kramer, what are you going to do?
I'd like to hear that.	Yeah.
Well, I'm not saying that!	Kramer, she was murdered!
What did they put on this tuna?	So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
Taste this, is this a dill?	No, it's tarragon.
Tarragon?	Well, take it easy.
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug.	Oh, no.
No, you're crushing my sandwich.	Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
Mint?	No thanks.
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.	It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?	No, I don't.
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.	Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me.	How much did you wound up tipping her?
Oh my God, I forgot!	Well, communism didn't work.
Any mustard?	Yeah, there's a new one in there.
No no, I don't like this one.	Help yourself.
Getting something to eat.	Kramer, here!
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?	What?
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's.	Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
What?	That's always the first question with you.
All right, so what did they do?	I don't know.
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.	Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum.
Excuse me, Jerry?	Hi.
Could we speak for a few moments?	Sure.
Hi, Jay Crespi.	Hello.
First of all, that was a terrific show.	Oh thank you very much.
So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.	I'd be very interested in something like that.
Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series.	Okay.
It was very nice meeting you.	Thank you.
Nice meeting you.	Nice meeting you.
What was that all about?	They said they were interested in me.
For what?	You know, a TV show.
Your own show?	Yeah, I guess so.
They want you to do a TV show?	Well, they want me to come up with an idea.
Come on, how hard is that?	Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
Because you're a gymnastics teacher.	But gymnastics is not for everybody.
I know, but he's your son.	So what?
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you.	Yeah and.
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.	What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
Why not?	So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam?
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.	No they're not, they used to be.
Oh yeah, like you know.	Oh like you do.
Come on, this is a great idea.	I don't think so.
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.	I don't think the network will go for it.
Why not?	Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
Kramer.	Hello Newman.
Yeah, sure.	What's this all about?
We're making a trade.	I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
Well my girlfriend had one.	You have a girlfriend?
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.	I never remember you with a girl.
Nevertheless, .	This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer.
Don't say anything.	All right.
All right.	You know you're getting gypped over here.
You let go  come on .	Gimme that  just gimme that.
Thanks buddy.	Does that thing work?
Really?	Yeah, they're in London now.
So, what's happening with the TV show?	No, nothing.
Why don't they have salsa on the table?	What do you need salsa for?
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.	You know why?
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa.	"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?
See, this should be a show.	What?
This.	Yeah, right.
I'm really serious.	Just talking?
It's about nothing.	No story?
No forget the story.	You've got to have a story.
Who says you gotta have a story?	And who is on the show?
I could be a character.	You?
Yeah.	So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
Yeah.	And who else is on the show?
Elaine could be a character.	Now he's a character.
Right.	And it's about nothing?
Absolutely nothing.	So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
We go into NBC.	"We"?
Writer.	You want to go with me to NBC?
Yeah.	What do we got?
An idea.	What idea?
An idea for the show.	I still don't know what the idea is.
It's about nothing.	Right.
Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.	So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
Exactly.	They say, "What's your show about?
There you go.	I think you may have something there.
I think you may have something there.	So, the show would be about my real life.
No, I don't think so.	What do you mean you don't think so?
I don't like it.	I don't understand.
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.	Why not?
well it just doesn't sit well.	You're my neighbor.
That's your problem, buddy.	I don't understand what the big deal is.
Hey, I'll tell you what  you can do it on one condition.	Whatever you want.
I get to play Kramer.	You can't play Kramer.
I am Kramer.	But you can't act.
Phew!	Okay, fine.
Use me for what?	Nothin' What do you want?
You gave me a defective detector.	Buyer beware.
No, but there's karma, Kramer.	Karma Kramer?
And one more thing.	Salsa, seltzer.
Nothing.	You sure?
No, I'm fine.	What, are you nervous?
No, not nervous.	What?
I can't do this!	This was your idea!
What idea?	Dont' worry about it.
They're men with jobs, Jerry!	I told you not to come.
I need some water.	They'll give us water in there.
Really?	Oh God, it's Joe Devola.
Who?	This guy's a writer, he's a total nut.
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut.	Oh God he saw me.
Hello Jerry.	Hey Joe!
You're under no obligation to shake my hand.	Oh, no, Just a custom.
Why shouldn't I look good?	Oh, no reason.
You want to hit me?	What are you doing here?
I dreopped a script off.	AH, GOOD FOR YOU.
AH, GOOD FOR YOU.	Well, .
You don't have to say anything.	No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
Why?	Kramer's party.
Kramer's .	No, no, he's not having a party.
Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.	No, I'm sure you are.
No, I'm sure you are.	Give my best to Hinckley.
What was that?	I can't believe what I just did.
Okay, okay.	Relax.
Yeah, they're not better than me.	Course not.
Who are they?	They're nobody.
What about me?	What about you?
Why them?	Why not you?
I'm as good as them.	Better.
You really think so?	No.
The parakeet in the mirror.	Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
Well, possibly.	Oh, it was very funny.
Pepe.	Oh, Pepe.
So, what have you two come up with?	Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways.
May I?	Go ahead.
The show is about nothing.	Well, it's not about nothing.
No, it's about nothing.	Well, maybe in philosophy.
You read?	Well, I don't know about the reading.
How is that a show?	Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
No, no, no.	Well, something happens.
How about this I manage a circus.	I don't even want to talk about it anymore.
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call.	IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!
Why?	Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
Wait a minute let me call Susan.	No, no this is more important.
She might be leaving to work any minute.	No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
Well, come on we're on vacation.	Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is.
Whoa, back up a second.	Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
Why would you think I would invite him?	I just a ssumed, .
Hello, oh, hello.	Of course.
All right go ahead Susan, tell him.	Tell me what?
Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service.	Oh, gee, I can't talk right now.
Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.	Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
No.	Well now you know how I feel.
Well, go ahead, tell him.	Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
Yeah.	What's the expiration date on that?
September third.	The third?
I never should have brought her up there.	I think SHE saw it coming.
You know she was behind the idea.	Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
What, are you crazy?	Vommiting is not a deal breaker.
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.	What happened to you?
Devola came after me.	What?
Can I have a coffee.	Boy, that is some kick.
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life.	Wow, Newman's helmet.
I got bad news for you buddy.	Me, why?
He doesn't like you.	What does he want from me?
Wait a second.	Where the hell did I put this?
What are you looking for?	The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote.
No, no, no.	All right, what is this?
what is what?	All right, very funny.
You're in a weird mood.	Come on.
Fix what?	Your pants!
what is this?	Don't you know?
No, t's a joke.	Go look at your face in the mirror.
Whahuhwhahuh.	yeah?
It's George.	Come on up.
I don't believe this.	You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
No, I swear.	I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola.
A drycleaning bill?	From that woman at NBC?
Yeah, your milk.	He drank it.
I didn't know.	All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
Yeah.	How much was it to clean the vest?
Eighteen dollars.	Can you get vomit out of suede?
Yoyo Ma!	What?
What about him?	You just said 'Yoyo Ma'.
What's Yoyo Ma?	He's a cellist.
All right, come on, come on, let's go.	I can't believe she sent you that drycleaning bill.
I know!	That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
The show!	Oh, yeah.
Anyway.	What are you doing?
What?	NBC!
They wanna have another meeting?	I don't know about sixty.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty!	Ted Danson!
I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.	Yes, you did.
Oh!	You know, I think he wears a piece.
Yeah, don't worry.	I'm ten minutes slow again!
What, is that the one your parents gave you?	Yeah!
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.	I'll pay for it.
It's not the money!	Well, what is it you object to?
Jerry!	Uncle Leo!
Helloooo!	Hello there, how're you doing?
Ha ha!	Good, good.
How's your mom and dad?	Good, fine.
What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call?	Oh, no.
You know where I just came from?	Oh, sure.
He used to be in the pajama business.	Oh, yeah, yeah.
The funny thing is I can't wear 'em.	II'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Oh.	We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
Nobody got a gun to your head!	Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.
Go.	I'm sorry, really.
You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!	Sorry, really.
Don't step on anything.	You see the look on my uncle's face?
I didn't shave this morning.	You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire.
Look at this.	Why didn't you shave this morning?
'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.	Why?
Because of the day before.	Is that Joe Davola?
It's not him!	I can't live tlike this.
Mister Seinfeld?	Oh.
Mister Seinfeld?	All right.
Care?	Wouldn't tune in.
Would they tune in?	No tune.
The show will be like a heart attack!	Just a huge massive coronary.
Isis that what I said 'no story'?	He couldn't believe it.
Well, we would like to be in business.	We would love to be in business.
Would it be possible to get aaa copy of 'La Cocina'?	Your offBroadway play.
Oh, oh.	Hmm, hmm.
Oh!	Oh!
See?	Yeah!
I told you, I told you!	Now, all we gotta do is write it.
Hey!	Thanks.
Oh, thank you.	Thank you, thanks.
Mister Seinfeld, you have a phone call.	Phone call?
Bye.	Bye thanks.
Bye, thanks.	Why?
I offered to pay.	She did, you insisted.
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.	Nah!
How much are we gonna get for this?	oh, I dI don't know.
Oh, gotta get fifty.	Okay.
Thirteen thousand?	Thirteen thousand.
a piece?	No, for both!
That's insulting!	Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
Well, he does.	You're nuts!
I'm sorry.	He's somebody.
What about me?	You're nobody.
Why him?	He's good, you're not.
I'm better than him.	You're worse, much much worse.
What?	Outside!
Nah, you don't understand.	Go outside and see if he's still there.
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.	Well, what are we supposed to do?
Tell the cop.	Good idea.
Yeah, all right.	Thanks.
Thanks.	He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside.
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.	What are you doing?
What?	What, are you ordering food now?
Yeah!	What happened to the muffin?
I got a little hungry.	All of a sudden you get hungry?
Yeah!	No!
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.	All of a sudden he gets hungry.
You know, a muffin can be very filling.	I know!
What's the matter with you?	Do you see him?
I'm not sure.	Well, either you see him or you don't.
All right.	What is he doing?
What's with this guy?	Did you just order coffee?
Yeah.	This is really too much.
What is your problem?	Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes.
You're off your rocker.	Hey you guys!

What are YOU doing here?	Hey, is Davola outside?
Davola?	Yeah.
Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.	Eleven dollars for what?
Muffin, sandwich and coffee!	Hey, NBC okayed our idea.
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?	No.
What's the difference?	Hey Newman, is that your red car?
Yeah.	I think you're getting a ticket.
I saw the whole thing!	Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
Ah, get outta here.	Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
And they liked the idea?	Yeah.
Since when is George a writer?	What writer?
This is so exciting.	Soon, there's a couple of problems.
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.	What do you expect?
They give you that Fish.	How could you eat fish on a plane?
What kind of problems?	Well, George doesn't think 13,000 is enough money.
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.	We're going to sign it.
Were you waiting long at the gate?	Um, I don't even know?
Where's that watch we bought you?	Oh uh .
Oh uh .	That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it.
WhaIs that the one your parents gave you?	Yeah, but it never works.
I got a guarantee on that watch.	It's at the jeweler.
You send me the bill.	I'm not sending you the bill.
Here, I got it.	What are you talking about?
No, no put it away .	Dad!
Stop it.	I have money.
Yeah, yeah, you make money.	You don't think I make money.
No, I don't think that.	Yes you do.
I'm paying.	Dad I'm paying.
Get out of here.	You're not paying.
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father.	No don't do this.
No don't do this.	Boy, you got a lot of stuff here.
Nothing nothing.	Leave it.
All right, all right.	You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.	Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?	I didn't know he wasn't invited.
So why did you say anything?	It was a mistake.
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?	He's got like a chemical imbalance.
Oh, yeah, yeah.	Kramer!
He's what?	He's joking.
He's after you?	Nooo.
Why is he after you?	He's not after me.
I'll make a few phone calls.	Who you gonna to call?
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.	I didn't do anything.
Well you must have done something.	No, he just doesn't like me.
Doesn't like you?	You know it seems impossible.
Huh, Jerry, don't say that.	It's true.
Yeah, I like him.	Um, I haven't got my watch on.
When you getting it back?	Uh, next week.
Next week?	Huh?
I said how come it's takin' so long?	I don't know.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?	Where'd I take it?
Yeah.	Where did I take it?
What?	Yeah.
Yeah, I know the guy.	No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
No, I'd be happy to.	I'd like to follow the regular procedures.
I get that too.	Be right back.
Be right back.	There's no watch .
YYeah, all right.	All right.
Julie, you want to take him back?	You what?
ahhhhh  Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave.	Let me explain to you what you just did.
Ooooo, I'm scared.	We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place.
Ohooo what are we going to do?	Well, I think you're wrong.
Well, we'll just see.	Yes we will.
Yes we will.	I just said that.
I know you did.	So good for you.
So good for you.	What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?	Well George is an idiot.
Oh hey, by the way.	No I don't want ?
Castro eh?	Yeah?
Federal Express.	Federal Express?
Wooo, you know what you just did?	You think so?
Federal Express?	So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.

What?	It's a tell.
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?	Good, going good  And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting.
You almost did the nose.	What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers?
What?	You're off bread.
No not quite.	Why not?
He has this power over me, okay.	Svengali.
What did I say?	Svenjolly.
Svenjolly?	George?
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.	Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
I don't think so.	Nice try.
Okay, okay.	So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
Hello.	Hi Uncle Leo.
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.	Hey, where's the waiter.
Let me see that.	Could we continue this another time.
George turns down the offer from NBC for the show, telling Jerry he's negotiating.	It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they?
I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman.	Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas.
She's very attractive.	She's okay.
Just okay?	She's nice.
She's better than nice.	She's all right.
She's beautiful.	She's not beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.	So you ask her out.
I'm not gonna ask her out.	Why not?
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.	She's pretty.
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.	I think that's a little extreme.
And how was yours?	Ah, very good.
You should try our mousse.	No thanks, just the check.
What's the matter with you?	What?
Why didn't you flirt with her?	Come on.
She was flirting with you.	What am I gonna say?
You just sat there.	Well, you made me uncomfortable.
Where's the bathroom?	In the back, on your right.
In the back, on your right.	Dad!
Jerry.	Will you let me pay just once.
You're out of your mind.	How you gonna pay?
Don't worry about it.	What're you gonna do?
You're not paying.	Alright, fine.
They give you some portion here, huh?	Uh, yeah.
Aw, no, no, I understand.	So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
Yeah.	Oh, heh.
Well, I haven't seen too many like  these.	Yeah, I know.
Aww, sure.	Hang on a second.
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?	Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go.
Jerry, I'd give you the watch.	Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost.
I've never seen a band like this.	Aww, right.
You have it on you?	Yeah, I think I do.
Yeah, I think I do.	This is unbelievable.
No, I don't think so.	I can't believe I'm doing this.
Really?	Oh.
Oh yeah.	Uh huh.
Why?	They eat fish.
Did you say Elaine?	How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes?
You shoulda told me it didn't work.	I know, I know.
You didn't have to throw it out.	I was always late.
Oh, that must be Leo.	I woulda taken you to the airport.
He has nothing to do.	Neither do I.
It's George.	Come on up.
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?	Ah, George turned it down.
He turned it down?	Yeah.
Why did he do that?	Because of Ted Danson.
Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.	Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
What'd I do?	What about NBC?
Hey!	Heyy!
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son.	Aww.
You have no idea how refreshing that is.	So what'd we get?
Eight thousand dollars.	Beautiful!
Four thousand apiece?	Lemme see if I understand this.
I was wrong, you were right.	You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go.
You're smart, I'm dumb.	You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
That's gotta be Leo.	Yeah?
Leo.	Alright, we're coming down.
Alright, let's get going.	Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.	A present.
Hey!	C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
He's something, you son, isn't he?	Ah hah, alright, let's go.
You're a terrific kid.	Okay.
You're very special.	Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
Alright, Leo.	Hey, uncle Leo.
Hi, hi.	How you doing?
How you doing?	This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
Yeah, I hate to give it up.	Yeah.
Jerry!	Alright, I'm just joking.
Morty, always a pleasure.	Take care now.
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.	Oh, he took it.
You're kidding.	He lost all that cash.
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone?	Well this is it.
Oh, this is nice.	Oh, you're welcome.
Yeah, me too.	No, I ate the whole plate.
 Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha .	No, I mean, I don't think so.
I thought you liked to laugh.	No, no, no.
Ahahahahahahahahaha.	That's not funny Naomi.
Ah hahahaha.	I didn't mean to be funny there.
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?	Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.	Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
What do you mean not goin'?	Nah, it's better anyway.
WhWell maybe you should ask Elaine.	Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer.	Yeah, .

I didn't burn it down  Kramer did!	I mean, the whole thing is ironic.
Yeah, I know what happened.	No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer.
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today.	No, no, we put this off long enough.
I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this.	C'mon.

Let me tell you what I think.	Please, and be brutal.
Are you very fussy about your pants?	I don't think I am.
Because I have a very radical idea.	Try me.
Here's what I'm proposing.	Everything?
Everything.	You're quite mad, you know.
Hey.	What are you doing?
I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.	No.
What?	This is not a good time.
Five minutes.	What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
Because I've been watching too much.	Yeah, but now you're in here all the time.
Well, wow.	Marla, Kramer.
Hey.	Why don't you go out?
Oh, no.	There's weather.
Weather?	I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
No, no, I don't want it back.	I don't know.
Will you tape it?	Kramer.
Yeah.	So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
Never came back.	Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
It was about to end anyway.	Ah hah.
It's me.	Come on up.
I didn't get it.	Ugh.
Well, he wanted me to move in with him.	Snapple?
No thanks.	Go on.
Well I wouldn't move in because.	Yes.
Well because.	Yeah.
Hello!	Hi, um.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.	Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late.
No, no, I'm leaving.	I like that thing in your hair there.
I should be going.	So we'll talk about the hooks then?
What?	She's a virgin, she just told me.
Well I didn't know.	Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
Well you think I should say something?	No, no, I mean.
'Cause I'm not antivirgin.	Elaine, Elaine.
She's a virgin?	A virgin.
Wow.	I don't know.
I don't think I could do it.	You need a little pioneer spirit.
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back.	Yeah, me too.
We gotta get something.	All right, but then we gotta get some work done.
Eh.	All right, let's go.
Where's the food?	Don't worry, he'll be here.
Hey, what about this?	Yeah.
My car's totaled.	Your butler?
Right.	What about me?
Don't worry, we'll find something for you.	That's the stupidest idea I ever heard.
Head hurts.	What happened?
I only saved one bag.	Should I call an ambulance?
Hey, you got the food?	Yeah, here.
I did not jaywalk.	You're givin' him back that TV.
Hey, look.	A month and a half we had.
All right, let's postpone it.	What do you mean?
I'll fake an illness.	No, no, would you get up?
I can do this, Jerry.	No.
All right, I'll tell them my sister died.	What?
Mr.	Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star.
Hey, Jerry.	Hi, how are you doing?
Hello, Jerry.	Oh, uh, nice to meet you.
He, uh, had to go to LA.	Oh, poor Blossom.
Where's George?	Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
David Letterman's on the floor?	Yeah, he just walked by.
Well, I think we should get started anyway.	Yeah, good idea.
So how are you guys comin' along?	Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
So that's the idea?	Well no, that's one.
Oh, Rita.	Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.	So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
You, you guys wanna hold it down?	Would you give him the TV back?
this is great!	Why did he fire her?
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!	You can't break up with her now.
What?	You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Another job?	Couple of interviews.
Are you gonna leave after its over?	What?
You know, the apartment.	Why would I leave?
Well what if it was my apartment?	Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.	Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships.
Maybe I should get going.	What else did you say to her?
Nothin'.	More like a dope was giving it to her straight.
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.	What is that about leaving after sex?
You might've if I'd stayed.	I was trying to be.
Look at George.	Oh, you're not kiddin'.
Who, me?	You, anybody  whatever.
Hi.	What's the matter?
My mother caught me.	"Caught" you?
She caught you?	Where?
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.	What did you do?
No, I guess you couldn't have.	No, I wouldn't think so.
Her back went out.	"Glamour"?
Oh, gimme a break.	Ohhh yeah.
You don't think I can?	No chance.
You think you could?	Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
Care to make it interesting?	Sure, how much?
A hundred dollars.	You're on.
Wait a second, wait a second.	You?
Yeah.	You'll be out before we get the check.
Why?	It's apples and oranges.
What?	Because you're a woman!
So what?	It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
Oh.	We have to do it.
Alright, you're in for onefifty.	Okay, onefifty.
Whatever.	How is she?
She'll be fine.	Yeah?
It's me.	Come on up.
Hey, what are you doing tonight?	Dating Marla.

Hey, look at this, c'mere.	Where?
Wow!	Who walks around the house like that?
I would imagine it's all naked.	What about the chamber maids?
Well,  where's my money?	Not me.
What're you looking at?	There's a naked woman across the street.
This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life.	Yeah.
So then, I got a call this morning.	Uhhuh.
Well, that was fast!	Well, it was that woman across the street.
Let's slow it down a little.	"Slow it down"?

Do you hear what you're saying?	Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.	Kramer,  get outta my way!
No, no, no.	Alright.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.	She's not there!

John F.	What?
He was in my aerobics class.	Really?
I said, "yeah.	Good one.
So then, listen, listen.	But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
Oh, that's good.	The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round.
All you got is instant coffee?	I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside!
It's Elaine.	Come on up!
Where did you get those socks?	I don't know.
I think those are my socks!	How are these your socks?

I know how difficult this must have been for you.	You don't know the half of it.
What do you mean?	Well, it's kinda silly, but.
Contest?	No, it was just a bet.
What happened?	I told her about the contest.
Yeah, he was talking to Marla.	Marla?

They don't get that much.	Let's ask him.
We can't ask him.	Let's see what he says.
Jerry, we don't have time for this.	Two seconds.
Depends on the person, depends on the bag.	Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
People like you?	C'mon, seriously.
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us.	All right, look, we're late.
Wait up!	You see?

Who am I going to meet who is better than her?	When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
I loved her!	You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
I gotta call her.	George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
Whyie?	You need some professional advice.
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.	No, no no  Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours .

Really?	Yeah, he's good.
Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me.	George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.	So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment?	Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
That's horrible!	What's that perfume you're wearing?

It's here somewhere.	It smells like the beach.

Well, you know.	Oh yeah.
What?	Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
Carefully?	Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see .
What?	Here.
Oh my God!	That's what I thought.
That's my nipple.	DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.	Well, maybe no one noticed it.
No.	Oh what's the difference.
Okay.	Take a look at this card.
Your nipple's showing.	Okay.
Anything else?	No.
All right.	What?
I got them too.	Everybody's got them.
No, No, No, No, Oh, No.	Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
Was it a scratch or a pick?	It was a scratch.
Hey.	Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?	Yeah?
It's me.	Come on up.
Was there any nostril penetration?	There may have been some incidental penetration.
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick.	Is that so unforgivable?
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker.	Let me ask you something.
Got any Double Crunch?	yeah.
That's mine.	I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
I thought you said it was a scratch.	But that's not what she thinks.
Why don't you call her agency.	All right.
Neither do I.	Hello there you are.
What are you doing here?	Well, I had to talk to you  I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
I'd rather not talk about this.	But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
I know what I saw.	But there  but there was no pick!
I gotta go.	No!
So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake.	The pick?
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist.	I think I've seen that look.
I've got the magazine.	Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
The show has been delayed.	You don't understand.
I hear you, guy.	And I'm doin' Letterman Monday.
Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?	No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie CheckMate'' at 1030.
Hey, Jer!	Heeeeyyyyyyyy.
Jerry!	What are you doing here?
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.	Take the Park!
Jerry, I want you to do me a favor.	Okay, I get your point!
Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.	That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
Jerry!	I gotta get out of this cab.
But Jerry, quit riffing!	No, I'm not riffing.
Jerry, could you do me a personal favor?	Your trench coat in my closet?

Oh man!	I didn't even use the ticket!
I still paid for it!	I only have a twenty.
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.	Elaine, that's what mail is.
Hi!	Hey, how ya doin?
Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.	Hey, is that Babu?
Jerry!	Look at you, you got the job.

Oh, yes, yes, everything wonderful.	Ok, I'll see you around the building.
I'll see you in the building.	Remember Babu Bhatt?
Yeah, yeah.	Can you bring my mail then?
Why didn't Kramer pick it up?	Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
Oh yeah, right.	Monday, I think.
Stop it, you're killing me!	He never heard of corduroy!
Well I think I'm better off going oneonone.	I don't know why you want to play mantoman when you could play a zone.
Why?	We'll be funny.
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.	No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
Why?	No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.
Toasting makes me uncomfortable.	Look who's here!
What happened to the auto show?	Oh, we're still going, we're still going.
Is your last name Benes?	How did you know?
No!	That's so funny!
Tell Ping I said hello.	Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.	What?
This is not good.	What's the matter?
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.	Why not?
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.	Biff?
What?	You're not worried about that?
No, of course not.	I mean, so what if I'm funny?
This is so ridiculous.	I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
You don't?	No way!
No, it's not.	Of course I can, am I being funny now?
A little.	Oh, this is funny?
Yeah.	George, is this funny?
Hi.	Hello.
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?	Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown.
Here, take it.	Well thank you very much, it's about time.
Oh listen, guess what?	Drop the case?
Yeah, no kidding.	Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.	Hear that?
Hey.	I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.	Why?
Uh, well there was an incident.	What happened?
I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.	What?
Mickey Mantle.	What happened?
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate.	You plunked him.
Oh yeah.	Wow, this is incredible!
Leave me alone!	What's going on out there?
What are you doing?	Babu?
They took Babu away?	Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired.
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired.	I will, Babu!
What?	Well this is interesting.
What is it?	It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form.
Well, doesn't he need that?	If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.	Yeah, so am I being funny now?
No, actually, you're not being funny now.	See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time.
No, and you weren't funny last night either.	Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl.
What do you need her for?	Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.	Ah, will you stop it already?
Jerry, please?	How long is this gonna go on?
Till I'm comfortable.	Well, when is that gonna be?
After consummation.	Consummation?
I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor.	That's wonderful news.
I think it's curdled.	I don't care.
Do you ever laugh?	Not really.
That's so sad.	I'm a comedian.
Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?	Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
Well, after we met, you were all so nice.	Babu!
Jerry!	You remember Elaine.
So nice of you both to come.	Oh, Babu.
We try.	We do what we can.
The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail.	Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu.
Oh yes, of course.	Oh, I don't want to bother you.
You had my Visa application?	Well not technically.
I kill you!	Well what about her?
I kill both of you!	Babu?
No Babu!	Babu, I'm gonna fix everything!
The wheels are in motion?	The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
So, what's up with Babu?	I don't know, I don't understand it.
It's George.	C'mon up.
C'mon up.	Babu must be back.
Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?	Where's Babu?
He is in Pakistan!	Who are you?
I am his brother.	I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
No, too fruity.	Hey, what happened?
She didn't help him?	No.
Where is he?	He's in Pakistan.
Oh boy.	What do you mean, oh boy?
Well, last night she told me that she liked you.	Told her the truth?
What do you mean, I got?	That's because she had my mail.
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.	How could you go in there?
Well, I had to.	Well, what happened?
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!	Yeah, it's funny!
I mean, we're not stupid, right?	It cannot not be funny!
Okay.	Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet.	Right, right.
I don't know, what do women say?	I don't know.
I don't even know what they think.	You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of.
Alright, forget Elaine.	Alright.
Hey.	Hey.
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.	Who?
Your old flame.	Did you talk to her?
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me?	So what happened?
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes,  "Oh, hi!	Yeah, I know about the three dates.
You know what I did?	What do you mean, you snubbed her?
I'm not even in here!	Yeah, I know.
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.	Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody.
You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?	Well, we tried.
You have no idea?	Something derogatory?
I thought I'd find you here.	Well, Gail Cunningham.
Hi, Elaine.	Why?
He snubbed me.	Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.	Nothing.
I thought you were finished.	I took two bites, how am I finished?
So, how come?	I don't know.
Well, tell him that I am mad at him.	Alright.
Pfeiffer's.	Ah, the power lunch crowd.
Really.	Would you care to join us?
No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant.	See ya.
"Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's.	That bothered you?
Yes, it bothered me.	It did?
Oh, she didn't think it was funny.	I thought your mother's paying for it.
I just kissed Gail Cunningham.	You what?
Yeah, I kissed her.	You kissed her?
Right on the mouth.	What kinda great friend are you?
She kissed me back.	I don't get this.
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!	So what?
Well, it's my stomach.	Oh, Where did you eat?
Pfeiffer's.	Ah.
Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.	Oh, you have a daughter?
Alright.	What?
Excuse me for a second.	What?
Would you like a PeptoBismol?	I'm not sure.
Pasta primavera.	Ah.
No!	Yeah.
More jokes?	Another ending?
A different name for the butler?	Maybe we should go.
Oh God.	I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there.
Hello.	Hi.
I'm Molly.	Oh, I'm Jerry.
George.	We're here discussing our script with your father.
Divorce is very difficult.	Uh huh.
Get a good look, Costanza?	What were you doing?
Well, it's not my fault.	You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke.
It's cleavage.	Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it.
All right.	That's why I poked.
Hey!	What?
Pasta primavera?	Is that what she said?
She's somethin', huh?	She is?
She's sensual.	Hello?
From NBC?	Yeah.
He poked me!	There was cleavage in the area.
But she was fifteen.	You don't consider age in the face of cleavage.
Alright, what's the difference.	You know what we could do?
Hey, now you're onto something.	The whole thing is so stupid.
Yeah.	No.
But.	Ya.
Yahhey.	Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor.
Alright, I'll call her right now.	Ok.
What do you mean, Gail?	Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all.
Beautiful.	Beautiful.
She wants my shoes?	No, come on!
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!	I'll get you another one just like it!
Sauce this.	Hey!
Look who's here!	Fancy meeting you here!
Pasta primavera!	You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
Didn't hear anything.	Didn't know.

Well, it's a funny idea.	It's funny!
C'mon, funny is funny.	Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.	If you can.

I got him a twoline phone.	Unbelievable!
What paper does she write for?	The works for the NYU school newspaper.
Never even seen you?	Y'know, you've been developing quite the acidtongue lately.
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?	Living or all time?
All time.	Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest.
So, whaddya say?	What's the matter with you?
C'mon, go along.	I'm not goin' along.
I'm not goin' along.	Y'know I hear that all the time.
Hear what?	That I'm gay.
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.	Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.	Oh yeah, what?
Yeah, how did you know that?	You told me that already like two months ago.
Allison bought it for me.	How you gonna get out of that one?
I dunno.	He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
Jerry did you wash this pear?	Yeah, I washed it.
It looks like it hasn't been washed.	So wash it.
Jerry said he didn't like it.	I didn't say I didn't like it.
No, you said you didn't like it.	Oh, so what if I don't like it.
So how did you two meet?	Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
Do you guys live together?	Live together?
And do your parents know?	Know what?
My parents?	Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us.
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us.	There's been a big misunderstanding here!
No, of course not.	I mean that's fine if that's who you are.
Absolutely.	I mean I have many gay friends.
Look, I know what I heard.	It was a joke.
No!	No steam!
Happy birthday paruba!	Today's not my birthday.
Well, I beg to differ.	Look at this!
Look at this!	Hey, where you going?
Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU.	Thank you very much, that's great click Oh!
Hey.	Hey, how ya doin'?
So, what did she say?	She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story.
Y'know.	What are you talkin' about?
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?	You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
Yes, I heard you!	Well, maybe she was disconnected.
Maybe she wasn't!	Alright, hang on.
Yello?	Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on.
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!	Oh no!
"The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye"!	Oh no!
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it.	No, no, of course not!
So she kept insisting I take off my coat.	She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"!	"Guys And Dolls"?
It's "Guys And Dolls", not "Guys And Guys".	"The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".
"The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".	What do you got there?
Now everyone's going to think we're gay!	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
I thought we were friends.	Here we go.
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?	It's not true!
Aaaah!	So are you.
Oh, my God.	Oh, my God!
Jerry?	Ma!
Jerry?	Ma, it's not true!
It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud!	Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
Excuse me, sir?	Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls".
Oh, my God.	What?
Oh, can you ever forgive me?	I dunno.
Y'know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately.	I was attracted to you, too.
Jerry!	What!
You're with a woman!	I know!
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do!	Would you get the Hell out of here!
Alright, tell her.	Tell her what?
Oh, what's the point?	Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll all be over.
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.	Yeah, how about a mute?
A mute would be good.	Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing.	A deep, yawning chasm.
There's gotta be more to life than this.	Listening to you.
Hey boys!	Hey!
Volunteer work, huh?	What're you gonna do down there?
Last time I had lunch with you here.	What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
What about you?	Nah, it's not for me.
What kind of a person are you?	I think I'm pretty much like you only successful.
Good luck.	Thank you.
Hey, what's your guy's name again?	Fields.
Ben Cantwell.	We?
So what's up, Diggity Dog?	George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency.

Trash.	You're throwin' this out?
"22 Explosive Hits", I don't know the other one.	You don't want any of this?
Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, Einstein.	You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
Well, take it.	Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee.
With you?	Well, maybe I'll get goin' then.
Bother me?	C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter.
I don't know what I'm going to do.	They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
I don't think it's gonna work out.	Whattya mean?
He fired me.	He fired you?
I dunno.	Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting.
I wish I could quit.	So quit!
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.	Oh yeah, you and your Sergio Mendes.
Wait, wait, wait, now.	Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
Yeah.	But you're going to have to go get em.
Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.	Yeah, I'm goin' there today.
Hey, what are those bums doin' back there?	Well you said they could come and take the records.
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body.	So Mr.
My teeth!	Where's his teeth!
I thought I saw something fly over here.	Well turn the light on.
Well turn the light on.	That's the garbage disposal!
It's Tim Fields, Mr.	Alright, c'mon up.
Alright, c'mon up.	I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
What the Hell is going on here?	I, I'm sorry.
Hey.	There you are.
Oh, hi Jerry.	Hi, Sidra.
Really.	Oh, yeah.
Well, I'm done.	Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
Thursday night.	Alright.
That's a pretty girl.	Tremendous girl.
She's the one you went out with last night?	Yeah.
You know, uh.	What?
Nah!	How do you know?
I can tell.	I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye.
Oh, right.	Yes, they do!
I never knew you were so into breasts.	A leg man?
No.	Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony.
I don't want to see her naked.	Well, I do.
Well, that's your problem.	Look, you made the allegation.
Jerry, what am I gonna do?	Yes!
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!	Don't be so sure.
What's his problem?	Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up.
Wrong side?	Yeah, she was on his right side.
He can't go left.	No!
So, when's the funeral?	You're sure?
Positive!	Well then, that's it.
What?	Just 'cause of that?
Oh, come on!	You don't touch the nose!
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?	Well, I take it very seriously.
Hey.	Hey.
Well, I know what they feel like.	You?
I do!	Real busy now down at the office?
I know what the problem is  I like her too much.	You put her on a pedestal.
I put them on a dental chair.	He puts 'em on a dental chair.
That's funny.	Yeah, funny.
Why, you think I should?	What, are you kidding?
Consolation Guy is big.	Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
It's like ten dates in one shot.	This confers upon you instant boyfriend status.
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.	You fell on her?
I touched 'em.	You what?
I.	You touched 'em?
I needed them to help me break my fall!	Wow.
Anyway.	Excuse me?
I think they might be real.	Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
I've touched mine!	So have I.
Oh, right.	Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real.	Aw, what are you doin' to me?
Yes.	I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real.
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.	But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life.
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!	Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
Hey!	Hey.
Pffft  wrong.	There's Sidra.
There's Salman.	Where?
Talkin' to that woman.	Talkin' to Sidra?
If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.	I don't think that's Salman.
Well, I don't think they're real.	If that's Rushdie, they're real.
If they're real, that's Rushdie.	Well, I gotta know  I'm talkin' to Sidra.
C'mon Jerry!	Oh, how can you be so sure?
Jerry, are you blind?	Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
What, did you ask her?	I'm gonna find out tonight.
I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy.	Hey, would you mind switching seats?
Why?	Oh, I don't know.
O.	How ya doin'?
Good.	Good, feel good.
I hear that's how she died.	Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem.
Well, a lot of women are having them done.	Really?
Yeah.	How do you like that.
A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.	Aw, you know people.
It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.	Oh, the nerve.
What do you tell them?	Whatever you want me to tell them.
Well, I think you'll find out soon enough.	No.
What if it's an emergency?	Oh, there's no emergency.
Jerry!	Excuse me.
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.	This is an emergency?
Well, I like yours.	I don't know, my bathing suit?
C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?	Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
Alright, c'mon!	Alright.
Hi, Jer.	Oh, hi, Elaine.
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico.	Oh.
I was just leaving.	Right, you were leaving.
I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.	That was an accident!
Not even close, huh?	You can't just have an adultery you commit adultery.
You met her at the supermarket?	Produce section.
So when're you gonna see her?	Tonight.
What's her name?	I.
How could you not know her name?	I was a little nervous, I got distracted.
I was a little nervous, I got distracted.	Look at that.
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you.	Yeah, I did that too.
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?	Sure.
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it.	Wow!
HuYeah, interest.	Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
Really?	Nobody you know.
Maybe I'll go down to the track.	Why don't you put it in the bank?
The bank?	Oh, you mean you wanna lose it.
Yeah.	Yes I did.
The whole apartment.	Wood is good.
Definitely.	So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.	O.
Yep.	What, you rented "Home Alone"?
Yeah.	I thought you saw that already.
No, I saw "Home Alone II".	Oh, right.
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one.	What for?
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything.	All right.
All right.	Yeah?
It's me, are you ready to go?	No.
I can't work with these!	What's wrong?
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves.	You said "gloves".
Hello.	Hey  get your stuff, let's get going.
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.	What?
eh, Remember Roy, the artist?	Oh, the "triangle" guy.
Yeah, exactly, the "triangle" guy.	Yeah, you liked him.
Yeah I did.	Artsy?
Fat.	Oh.
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know.	Yeah.
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.	What's wrong with him?
Yeah.	All right we'll wait for you.
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor?	Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
Well.	Well I think I can do that.
What's with him?	Y'know a lot of people have asked that.
Thank you.	Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend.
Jerry, did you hear this?	That's terrible.
You did.	You know I can't get this damn thing to sleep.
Okay, I'll tell you what.	Honey.

You're wrong.	No I'm not.

Oh, come on Jerry.	Yeah, that's true.
Ttu  Ttu.	Hey.
Hi.	What are doing, you crying?
No.	You crying from "Home Alone"?
The old man got to me.	Alright, just get yourself together.
Oh Shut up!	Oh, I never even got to the gym.
Oh.	Oh, he's okay.
Hnh.	Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants.
Y'know what it is?	You mean Florence Nightingale.
What'd I say?	Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton.
Clara Barton?	I'm not sure, but I think she was nice.
So, you gonna buy his art?	No.
Yeah, that's what I want triangles.	I will.
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name.	No, it isn't.
Yeah?	There are ways.
"Seinsmelled"?	Yeah.
Oh, oh Jerry.	Oh.
Now let's try "breast".	No.
Rest.	"Hest"?
What, you should've just asked her.	I know, I should've asked her.
What're you gonna do now?	I dunno.
Aretha!	No.
Bovary!	Alright, that's enough.
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse.	How am I gonna do that?
Ah,  there you are.	You asked a date to go to the operation?

No, they're good!	I don't want any!
Just take one.	No!
"Bingo"  with a small "splat" sound  falls into Roy, the patient.	Did it go in?
What do you mean "into the patient"?	Into the patient, literally!
Into the hole?	Yes, the hole!
Didn't they notice it?	No!
How could they not notice it?	Because it's a little mint.
WcaWhat did they do?	They sealed him up with the mint inside.
They left the Junior Mint in him?	Yes!
II guess it can't hurt him.	Yes they eat them.
Yes they eat them.	Yeah.
It's me.	Come on up.
Hey.	Why did you force that mint on me?
Well, I didn't believe you.	How could you not believe me?
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint?	That's true.
It's very refreshing!	Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine.
Prognosis.	Prognosis negative!
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something.	We gotta confess.
Really?	Yes!
We could be tried for murder.	I can't have this on my conscience.
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?	I'm telling and you can't stop me!
Hey Elaine?	Oh yeah, that's the spot.
What're you so tense about?	Oh, nothing really, just a homicide.

Listen, lemme ask you something.	It means he's lying.
Wow.	Why?
Yeah, last night.	No.
Jerry!	Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will always trade sleep for sex.
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?	Anything's possible.
Anything's possible.	What's the matter with you?

Oh, this isn't even B.	There should be a B.
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now.	Lemme see if I understand this.
Lemme see if I understand this.	Here he is.
What do you mean "stunk up"?	I mean the car stinks!

Gagliano's.	Well.
Get movin'.	Yeah.

Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's our TV!	I know it is!
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!	I hate the Drake!
They don't know anybody in Chicago.	Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
Hey.	Hey, guess what?

Will they give us cash?	That's their policy.
Why can't I play Kramer?	Look we've been through this already.
Neither are you.	I know.
Oh come on Jerry.	My grandmother's in the hospital.

I'm in the middle of a conversation here.	Get off the phone!
Look, I'll call you back.	You know I'm waiting to hear from them.
Russell Dalrimple's secretary.	All right.
Right here.	Get out of here, it's nothing.
It's all white Jerry!	Would you stop?
Again with the checked out.	If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
Catch what in time?	Whatever it is.
Ah!	You know these squeegee Oh my God!
O.	Yeah, where is Russell?
Hey how you doing?	They've gotta be kidding.
Hi Michael.	Everything all right?
It's like a bald convention out there!	No you didn't.
O.	Uh, you know what?
Oh, great.	Alright, want to start?
Yeah.	O.
Ahem.	What look?
That look you just gave me?	I gave a look?
How you doing?	Good.
Sure.	It was a wonderful reading.
Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.	Yeah, I liked him.
This is Martin Van Nostrand.	What are you doing here?
So who's playing Elaine?	Oh, don't worry about it.
Really?	Yes.
Who is it?	She's an eskimo, actually.
Listen, was Russell at the casting?	No, he didn't show up.
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him.	No.
Why do I keep setting you up?	I don't know.
Could we get a little more?	Yeah.
Mmm.	Beside that.
Yeah?	What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
Ah.	I mean look at this.
Yes, I would say.	What's going on here.
Do you think it's a coincidence?	No.
You know what?	Hey that's life.
A biopsy!	What did he say?
He said he didn't know what it was.	Alright.
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here".	Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"?	Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
No I can't.	Hey.
You got mugged?	Mugged?
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.	Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
It was full.	Yeah?
It's me.	Come on up.
But now I have a big problem, buddy.	What is it?
Well, I waited so long I I missed my chance.	You didn't go?
No.	The  thing to do is just not think about it.
What's the matter with him?	He's a little backed up.
It's a coincidence.	This is what you gonna wear?
Yeah.	You're not gonna get the job.
Exactly.	Hello.
Who was it?	TV Elaine.
What about the dogs?	They're having sex in the hotel room.
So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.	Yes.
And she's really your exgirlfriend?	Uh, Huh, yeah.
I want to get to know her from the inside.	Well, she's fascinated with Greenland.
How would she eat a hamburger?	With her hands.
What about pasta?	Also with her hands.
Seriously.	Everything?
Everything.	All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
That's good.	Shaft.
You got to get me a picture.	She likes talking during sex.
Oh.	No.
Elaine.	What?
Call me Elaine.	All right.
Like this?	I think you got it.
What do you mean made up?	It's made up.
You're crazy.	No I'm not.
This guy stinks.	Danish.
Yep.	George?
Why is that?	I don't know, but they don't seem to like it.
Oh, you're fine.	Why would he steal a box of raisins?
What's the matter?	Nothing.
You're acting weird.	No.
Are you breaking up with me?	Are we going out?
You're breaking up with me, aren't you?	Do you want me to break up with you?
If that's what you want.	I don't even know what you're talking about.
Fine.	All right.
What do you mean?	Because I can't act!
Come on you're.	This show's gonna ruin my entire career.
What about me?	This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
The guy playing Kramer threatened me.	Why?
'cause I asked him about the raisins.	You mentioned the raisins.
Oh yeah.	Did he take 'em?
I don't know.	Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
That's what I'm trying to find out.	Hey.
Hey.	Any luck?
No.	What about bran?
I tried bran 40, 50 100.	Well my friend,  it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Pfft!	Oh, it's not that bad!
Well it's all taken care of.	So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
No.	Oh, come on you gotta go!
Jerry, this is not a crush.	We need you there!
Sandi, are you in wardrobe?	Try Elaine.
I can't remember my lines!	Just relax, you'll be fine.
I can't relax.	You're just like George.
Are you ready to meet our cast?	Good evening, folks.
Sic semper tyrannis?	Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
Really?	It means "Death to tyrants".
See, now this is exciting!	No, it starts in five minutes.
Yeah, me too.	Hey, what about Russell?
No.	Strange.
Wet and wild.	All right.
Hey, what's this?	A wallet?
Here.	Ah, man!
Shh!	How do you like that?
Hey.	Hey George.
New sneakers?	Yeah.
What do you need new sneakers for?	I like sneakers.
How do you make a decision which one to wear?	Nah, you're crazy anyway.
Come on Jerry, the commercials almost over.	All right.
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.	Oh yeah.
Really?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Hello, Charles.
Hello.	Why don't you start in the bedroom?
Hey.	Hey.
He is?	I'm not sending him to your house.
Why not?	Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Jerry, he is your butler.	But I don't want to.
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.	Yeah?
It's Elaine.	Come on up.
I need more Pledge.	More Pledge!
Hello.	What's all this about?
We had a date.	You had a date?
Why do I need your permission?	Because he's my butler!
You know that Kim Novak has some big breasts?	Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
Wow!	Let's go out and celebrate!
That was so good.	Come on let's eat something.
And God didn't kill me.	Hello?
Hi Jerry, this is Rita Kierson.	Oh, hi Rita.
I'm calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network.	Oh, my God.
To be honest with you.	Russell's disappeared?
In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC.	You're passing already?
Well, I just got the job.	Yeah, see ya.
What did I do?	Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
I can't believe this?	No one knows.
Peggy!	What a family!
Thank you very much.	What?
Karen.	Is she nice?
Great.	So you like her?
I think so.	You don't know?
I can't tell anymore.	Well do you feel anything?
Feel?	All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
Yeah.	You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
Yeah.	On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
Yeah, yeah.	Okay, I think you're in love!
Tub is love?	Tub is love.
Hah.	So there you are.
Yep.	Sexual?
Yeeeaaah.	Below the equator?
Yeah.	Nobody does.
II don't know.	You got the tap?
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap.	The tap is tough.
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.	Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
No, no, this wasn't moving on.	It's a very complicated area.
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.	It's a haaazy mystery.
Of course.	Really?
On occasion.	And the guy never knows?
No.	How can he not know that?
Because I was gooood.	I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
You didn't know.	What?
You didn't know.	Are you saying.
I think I'll have a piece of cake.	With me?
Well.	You faked with me?
Ye.	You faked with me?
Yeass.	No.
Yeass.	You faked it?
I faked it.	That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Not bad huh?	What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
Fake, fake, fake, fake.	I'm stunned, I'm shocked!
Uuuhm, all the time.	All the time?
We got a chocolate malt in here!	But I'm so good.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you.	She faked.
She faked.	Maybe they've all been faking.
She was probably joking.	No no, it was no joke.
She didn't have any?	No.
She faked 'em all.	Faked 'em all.
Well so she faked 'em, so what?	The woman had an orgasm under false pretences.
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment?	How did she do it?
Yeah I could have helped you out.	What could you have done?
I could have given you some pointers.	I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
Aaaaah.	Don't aaaaah!
Giddyup.	Hello.
So we're having dinner tonight?	I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
Why?	What, the grilled cheese?
Nooo, the other thing.	Oooh that.
Oh come on, Jerry.	Yeah I guess.
Okay.	All right.
All right, see you later.	Bye.
You know, I faked it.	What?
Yeah.	You faked it?
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.	Yeah, but why would you.
It's terrible!	Did you get that at Joe's?
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.	That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
You know what I'm gonna do?	You're returning used fruit?
Mmm, hey, you know what?	Meryl Streep?
You don't like her?	Ah, she's okay.
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic.	Yeah.
I really admire actors, you know.	Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
What's the matter?	Nothing.
You're not still thinking about that are you?	Nooo.
Oh good.	Give me another shot!
What?	Another shot, I want another shot.
You mean.	Yes!
Oooh no, I don't think so.	Come on!
Jerry, we're friends!	Oh friendship.
Jerry no, that's important to me.	We won't ruin the friendship.
Ya, Yes we will!	Elaine.
No Jerry, it is out of the question.	A half hour, give me a half our.
No!	Okay, fifteen minutes.
Noo!	You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
What, no, it doesn't matter.	That's it, that's it.
That is so ridiculous.	Come on, Elaine!
No.	Elaine?
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.	Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
Goodnight.	Oh what, you're upset?
Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?	No I can't, maybe you're faking.
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.	I'm sorry too.
Well stop being such a baby.	You're a baby!
It's all your fault!	They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
I hate him!	You know it happens to everybody.
Hey.	Hey.
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?	Why can't you get it?
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.	What happened?
Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?	No.
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?	Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
The supermarket?	Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?	Hello.
Hello.	Patty Lawrence had 'em!
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Hello Elaine?
All right now here's the list.	All this?
I like mangos.	Avocado?
Well they gotta be soft.	How soft?
Not too soft.	Hmm ah.
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.	Uh huh.
Oh!	Plantains?
Yeah.	What the hell is a plantain.
It's part of the banana family.	You're not getting any plantains.
You're not getting any plantains.	Hey Joe.
How's it going?	Good, just getting some fruit for myself.
All right, all right, just hold it right there.	What?
This fruit isn't for you.	Wha, what are you talking about?
You think I don't know huh?	I can't buy mangos and plantains?
All right, get out!	You're making a big mistake, Joe!
I'll tell you something else I don't what your business anymore either.	Are saying you're banning me from the store?
That's exactly what I'm saying.	I'm banned?
All right, where do you want it?	Put it over there.

Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.	Sex.
I can't believe this.	Oh, it won't be for that long.
How can I do this?	Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
How can you compare you parents to my parents?	My father has never thrown anything out.
My father wears his sneakers in the pool!	My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
Listen carefully.	A smirk?
Maybe!	I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
Well, move in here.	What's that?
Hello, Mrs.	Hello, Mrs.
So, how are ya, Jerry?	Fine, Mrs.
Nah, not interested.	No, no.
What are you talking about?	No thanks.
I think you're all a little touched in the head.	I really don't eat it.
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?	I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building.
Oh, I gotta go move the car.	Well, I guess we'll be going.
What?	Yeah.
Wha  what are you doing later?	Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
Really?	Yeah, You can't believe this woman.

This woman just set me up for a job!	Well, what about my hands?
What, are you kidding?	Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
This is it!	It's just like in the movies.
Hey.	Hey.
But, it's only a toy!	George has become a hand model.
A hand model?	Yes.
Alright,  I gotta get going.	Oven mitts?
Yeah.	Alright.
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie.	Uhhuh.
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt.	What are you talking about?
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show.	This?
Yea.	I agreed to wear this?
Yeah, yeah.	But, when did I do that?
When we went to dinner the other night.	What are you, crazy?
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?	I don't know!
There you go.	Where I go?
Yes, yes!	But, I  I didn't know what she was talking about.
Well, she asked you.	I  I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV!
Well, you gotta wear it now!	They're making these?
Yes, yes.	But, I don't want to be a pirate!
Now that's a great looking shirt!	Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?
Why're you wearing that now?	'Why am I wearing is now?
When did she,  when did she ask you this?	When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
I didn't hear anything.	Of course not!
Wha What?	I have to wear it!
Back now, 746.	Thank you, Bryant.
And speaking of clothing, that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on.	Oh, thank you.
You're all kinda,  kinda "puffed up".	Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
You look kinda like a pirate.	Yeah.
You.	Uhhuh, yeah.
Are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert?	Look, it's not my shirt.
Whose shirt is it?	What's the difference?
Did you hear that?	THAT I heard.
You ruined me!	Oh, just keep your voice down.
Oh, I don't give a damn!	You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
Nice shirt.	Yeah.
My whole life is ruined because of the  "puffy shirt".	It didn't do me any good either!
You know all those stores canceled out on her?	Really?
I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.	What happened with all the shirts?
Ahh, can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer?	You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt.
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?	No.
No.	Yeah.
Hey.	Hey.
Well I got it!	You got me the air conditioner?
What do you think?	Beautiful!
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.	Is it a good one?
Good one?	Commando 8?
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy.	All right.
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?	Yeah.
I gotta get out of this city.	So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth?
I broke 'em playing basketball.	He was running from a bee.
George, those are prescription goggles?	There's a lot of change down there.
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.	We're behind you, Aquaboy.
Yeah, come on.	Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
Well, it's a tough decision.	Come on, George.
Yes, they are bold.	I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
Hey, you can't have that dog in here.	Are you okay?
My leg looks pretty bad.	Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
Okay.	Hey, any luck?
Uuh, no, no.	All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
Good, good, do that.	What's the matter?
Oh, no, nothing.	What is it?
Jerry, can we go?	Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second.
I can't tell you, don't ask.	I'm asking!
Jerry, my leg.	Yeah, yeah, take care of it.
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.	What?
They were right outside!	Amy and Jeffrey?
Yes!	Are you sure?
Yes, positive.	But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay?	We're gonna have to talk about this later.
Oh, come on.	Why not?
Jerry, that is so ridiculous.	But he was squinting.
So what?	Are you kidding?
Not shot, dog bite.	Nah, look at this.
Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv.	No, no, no.
Yesterday?	Yeah, you remember yesterday?
I didn't do anything.	Oh you must have done something.
No, nothing really.	Didn't go out of the house?
Well, I did go out for a little while.	Well, your day's getting more interesting already.
You can't thrust anyone.	No you can't.
What are you talking about?	Look, my friend saw you.
Saw me?	You tell me.
There's nothing to tell.	There isn't?
No.	Oh.
I had a feeling this was to good to be true.	Why?
I knew there had to be another side to you.	No, no, there's no side!
There is a side, an ugly side.	No, no, no ugly side.
Look, I think I'm gonna go.	Why?
It's really hot in here.	Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
Yeah.	It's coming!
It's coming!	I was an idiot for listening to you!
Hey, I saw what I saw.	Ooh, everything was going so well.
What side?	A bad side, an ugly side.
Ooh, so what?	So what?
Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?	Ah, he'd just deny it.
There must be some way to find out.	Amy said nothing happened.
What, you're gonna take her word over mine?	Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!
I was squinting!	They were mailboxes, you idiot.
Heh, Mercury head.	No, keep it.
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me.	A little white dog?
Yeah.	Snowball?
I'm afraid of dogs now.	He's like a squirrel.
All right, let me just.	Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!
I saw them making out, you can believe it.	I don't know what to believe!
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.	Hey wait a second, wait a second.
We'll see you Dwayne.	I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability.	Who picked these out?
I did!	They're ladies' glasses!
Hey!	Hey, hey.
Commando 8 has arrived!	Take it to the window.
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest.	Just in time for Amy.
Of what?	Rabies.
I know I don't want it!	Hey, hey, what is this?
What if Jeffrey's not home.	Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night.
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy.	He does look like a horse.
Hey who are you calling stupid?	Hey, shall we spit on him?
So what are we doing here?	Oh, you'll find out.
I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously.	Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.
I find it annoying.	Oh?
Helloooo!	Uncle Leo?
Come on in.	This is Amy.
Hello Amy.	Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
Jeffrey went out tonight.	Ooh!
I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature.	Oh really?
That's pretty rare!	Uncle Leo!
Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.	Thank you.
What tickets?	To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
We're going to the Paul Simon concert?	That's right, lady!
Oh what a great surprise!	I thought you'd like that.
Oooh, so that's why you've been acting so mysteriously.	Now you know.
He likes the spots.	Thank you.
Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message.	Aha!
What are you talking about, I don't know Jeffrey.	Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
What are you talking about?	Oh.
Oh my God it is them.	I still don't know how you spotted that dime.
Yeah.	So, does he like you?
What do you think?	You like him?
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.	So, how did you meet him?
In the office.	So, he's a writer.
Yeah.	Yeah, big surprise.
Ask your mother,  you live with her now, don't you?	So, what did you do?
Sounds like a cool guy.	Sounds like a jerk.
Jerry, where did you get that sweater?	Oh, what do you think?
Hey, that's Barry.	Hey.
Who's that?	That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money.	Hey Barry, how you doing?
Hey, how are you?	This is my friend George.
Nothing really.	Yeah, so how's my money?
Well it's still green.	What, you got a cold?
Oh, uh you like that?	Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.
Oh, great.	Did you see that?
What?	What was all that sniffing?
I don't know.	You don't think.
He was definitely sniffing.	I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money.
No, I have known this guy since college.	Then, what was all that sniffing?
Maybe it's the cold weather.	Today's not cold.
Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?	Sniffing, with his nose.
Jerry, he probably had a cold.	No, I asked him.
So, what are you saying?	I don't know, you know, what if.
Drugs?	I don't know.
Listen, we went in on a CD together.	I know.
And Newman gave you money too.	Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
Well, what else?	No, he didn't use 'man'.
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?	No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
Whoh!	Do you think that's a bad sign?
Yes!	I don't know.
Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!	You're out of your mind you know that.
Why?	It's an exclamation point!
Well, I felt a call for one.	A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything.
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.	George was right.
All right, here, you call him right now.	Good idea.
Prophet and Goldstein.	Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
I'm sorry he's out of town this week.	Out of town?
Yes, he went to South America.	South America?
South America?	I'll call back, thank you.
So what?	Who goes to South America?
People go to South America.	Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?	Yes, I'm impugning a continent.
Hey, hey.	Hello Newman.
Ohh, what are you gonna do?	Wait a second.
I feel Tuesday and Wednesday.	All right, shut up the both of you!
Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives.	Yeah maybe you should.
Yeah, me too.	All right, what are you gonna say to him?
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?	No, you stay here in the car.
Who made you the leader?	All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
Alright.	There he is.
All right, I'm going in.	Be careful Kramer.
I shoulda gone in with him.	No, you stay here in the car.
What you need me in the car for?	I might need you to get me a soda.
Me neither.	You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
I use dental tape.	You should try this.
I don't wanna.	Not even once?
No.	You're an idiot.
Why, because I use dental tape?	Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
No, no I don't like it.	What do you mean you don't like it?
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.	'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
Will that take care of ours too?	Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
Hey, you want me to mail it?	Yeah, thanks.
See'ya later.	You know this.
Hey, Ralph.	Hi Ralph.
What's up fellas?	All right.
Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?	Yeah.
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.	Mohair, I think.
Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair.	You mean you just started sniffing?
Yeah, mohair does it to me every time.	I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
The sweater!	Oh no!
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.	The what?
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.	Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
What is this?	It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
He is filing a chapter eleven.	Bankruptcy, bankruptcy.
All right, What about the money?	What about the money?
Nice.	Think so?
Yeah, what is it?	Half silk, half cotton, half linen.
And then doctor says.	Thanks, that's enough.
Will you look at that kid.	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look at that Jerry, look at that.	Yeah, I looked.
This doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it?	No, Uncomfortable?
Look at him.	So how long do they do this?
Jus, a year or two.	No break?
After that comes the weaning.	So after the sucking, comes the weaning.
First the sucking then the weaning.	Well, you gotta wean.
What about that spot I got?	Yeah, I saw the spot.
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital.	George.
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot.	Where's Kramer?
Did you give him the room number?	Ya, 1397.
You gotta look at this.	Will you shut up George.
I'm taking a cab home.	You were saying Stan?
Huuh, Wow.	Me?
Yes.	Never go against the family, Elaine.
That's great Kramer.	Elaine, never ask me about my business!
The most important thing is you help with the bris.	The bris?
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.	Well, maybe we should.
I don't know.	Maybe they're admiring your spot.
A Mohel!	A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
Where am I going to find a Mohel?	Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake.
Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?	You mean that wasn't uh.
Yeah.	No.
Ya.	What'd you think?
No, had no face, no personality.	Hey.
Well I just got the estimate.	Ah, you're screwed.
Well I have to interview a Mohel.	How about our little Elaine huh?
YEA!	What's the matter?
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed.	What now?
Look look.	"Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pigman is alive.	Oh, will you stop it.
I tell you something.	Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pigmen.
Yeah.	Hey George, you ever see one?
Yeah, my roommate in college.	So what'd you think?
I got used to it.	Alright, I'm waiting.
Oh, don't worry.	Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pigman cries out for help.	Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here.
What?	Oh, it's George.
He's lying.	Alright Kramer, enough of this.
Alright you go ahead.	Kramer.
Kramer.	Where's the Mohel?
He'll be here.	He's late already.
Relax.	I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather.
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.	Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in.
What about me?	Don't they have any closer friends.
Hello, Hello  Hello, I'm the Mohel.	Hello.
Hello!	Yeah.
Ok, go.	I'm going.
Go.	I'm going.
Alright, alright!	That damn Mohel  he circumcised my finger!
You flinched.	Flinched?
It was very traumatic.	Who's got a tissues?
What about the baby?	Oh the baby's fine.
Would you stop it?	A few stitches?
I have never seen a Mohel like that.	That was a one in a million Mohel.
I said I'm sorry.	Look at this.
Wha, where is he going?	Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel!
The circumcision was perfect.	Oh who made you a Mohel?
Ya See!	Nice Mohel picking, Elaine.
One more peep out of you and I'll slice you up like a smoked sturgeon.	Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.
Butcher Boy?	Ya what was this?
What was this?	It was not!
Outta My Way!	I can't do it.
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard.	Oh, that's the Flicks.
NO, he's not.	Myra, Stan.
During this closing monologue Jerry's finger is bandaged the same way it was during this episode.	Professional tennis.
Professional tennis.	Are these seats unbelievable or what?
Where's the sunblock?	Here.
25?	What, are you on Mercury?
I need higher.	You got a problem with paba?
Yes, I have a problem with paba.	You don't even know what paba is.
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?	I'll go if someone else drives.
Gwen really wants to go.	You're bringing a date to a party?
No good?	A party is a bad date situation.
Why'd you pick Hoover?	Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing.
Yeah I guess.	That woman is absolutely stunning.
Who, the Croat?	Not the Croat, the lineswoman.
Yeah, she's a B.	B.
No, no I said.	I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman.
Boy you are really smitten.	I gotta talk to her.
Cold?	I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.	I have to.
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here.	I can't.
What are you going to say?	I don't know, "Hi".
Yeah yeah, I know your type.	Excuse me.
And you're saying she's deaf.	I'm not saying she's deaf, she's deaf.
Can't hear a thing.	Can't hear a thing.
And you're going to go out with her.	Yeah, isn't that something?
Hey I know how to sign.	Really?
What is this about?	I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
You are kidding.	Wow good plan.
No.	That's nice.
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them.	That's nice for the freaks.
You got it.	Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity.
Well there ought to be ball men.	All right I'll talk to her.
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.	But I thought things were going great.
Yeah so did I.	Did she say why?
No.	But that's your routine.
She must have seen me eating it on TV.	So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it?
Why not.	Hello.
You're parents saw me on TV?	Yeah.
Can we move on?	He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.	Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws?
Excellent question.	I think she should withdraw.
I beg to differ.	Really.
He's the loser.	Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway.
Well we can take the car service from my office.	Really?
All right, I'll see you later.	Okay.
"To the victor goes the spoils.	Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
Oh.	Why?
Well I was just going to wander the streets.	Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
They never have napkins there.	Let's get the check.
Yea.	Really.
They're breaking up?	She reads lips.
Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea.	What?
We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.	She's not a novelty act, George.
Look.	I don't know George.
Could you ask her, just ask her.	All right.
All right.	Uh Laura, George was wondering if.
Sure.	So I really had a good time.
Yeah, me too.	So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
Yeah.	All right, we're taking a car service.
Oh I'll be up for it punk.	See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex".
She confused "six" with "sex"?	Yeah.
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?	Well "six" and "sex" are close.
It's two completely different sounds.	Eh.
It seems like a problem.	Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.	You're kidding.
Oh, when is that car service coming?	In five minutes.
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be?	I know.
Hey, hey, hey.	Can't do it Newman.
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office.	It's not going to happen.
All right, all right.	Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
Pardon me sir?	I said pull over by the stop sign.
What?	ca.
Hey buddy.	Hey Todd.
"Hi Gwen, hi tide.	Hi tide?
She's so wild.	No.
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.	I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.	Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
Oh.	I've always been a big fan of the little check move.
Fantastic!	I told ya.
Good.	How good?
Very good.	I know it.
They put real blue berries in this.	Coffee.
Let me testtaste that.	Huh?
Hmm!	Suave!
All right, let's just forget it.	You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
What do you mean?	He invested in it.
No kidding?	Yeah.
Jerry!	Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, god.	Who is it?
This guy from my old neighborhood.	Oh, oh.
Hi.	Hi.
He's a jerk.	He's gone, George.
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?	Oh, man, that yogurt place  you're going to make a fortune.
Yeah.	They're doing an incredible business.
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.	How did you know?
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown.	Yeah?
Buzz me.	Hey, I had the show of my life last night.
Yeah, but did you tape it?	Vvvvup.
Yes!	I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
Hey!	What's the matter?
Yeah, you look like you put on  five,  ten pounds.	Kramer!
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.	Me?
Yeah.	No.
Where's your bathroom scale?	I've gained eight.
Oh, my god!	How did I gain eight?
I don't get it.	Me, either.
No, no, no.	Well, how else could this have happened?
You don't eat Oreos?	What about me?
You?	Maybe your yogurt isn't so nonfat.
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.	There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
Uhhuh.	And they said they can do it?
Yeah, it's fortyfive bucks.	All right.
Well, I hope you're satisfied.	What?
Every word out of my son's mouth now is beep, beep, beep.	Gee, I'm really sorry.
He wants to be like you because you're a comedian.	I'd be happy to.
Well, I wouldn't hear of it.	Hello, Newman.
Hey, Seinfeld.	It was an accident.
Hurry, Jerry!	How's it doing?
Well, you can't have this tested now.	So what.
It changes the molecules.	Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
Hey, fatso!	You call me fatso one more time you're going to be walking back.
Ooh!	What do you got there?
Actually, this is Mr.	Oh.
Well, the pleasure's all mine.	You can't take that chemist out.
Why not?	Because she's like the jury.
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.	Well, I think the whole thing stinks.
It smells.	That's enough.
What?	With the smelling.
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor.	Uhhuh.
And I have to go.	Well, so, what are you going to do?
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George?	No, I believe he can.
Hi!	Hi!
See!	Listen, Matthew, II want to explain something to you.
You did it.	That's true.
He tells him which soap to use.	What the beep are you doing?
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why?	He said that?
Hey!	No, but I expect to hear anytime.
Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.	Why do you say that?
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.	Name tags?
Yeah!	Oh, I see.
He's become the laughing stock!	Hello?
Jerry, come on, look.	Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this.
It's hard to understand.	Nonfat yogurt?
Now look what you've done.	Well, we've got to do something.
Mine, too.	I can't eat this.
Hey, Jerry.	It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
Hey, you guys, listen to this.	So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat beep.	The oldfashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong?
That's it.	What do you mean that's it?
He never finished the sentence.	"Of course" was the last thing he said?
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately.	So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
And if I don't call.	You might have the job, but you'll never know it.
Hey.	Shower?
Haircut.	Oh.
I'm very happy with this.	Who'd you use?
The uncle Enzo.	Well I've been going with him for 12 years.
You can get a good one today.	Really?
And you didn't ask me to do it?	I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
Will you go ahead?	Okay.
Oh Jerry.	Oh hi Enzo.
Oh, you've come for the haircut.	No, actually I was just gonna.
It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer.	Well I, if it's your day off I really.
Eh, what's the difference.	Well I don't want to take too much off.
He massacred you.	I know.
You look like you're five years old.	What if I shampoo?
You've got to start seeing someone else.	I can't.
Well, you gotta do it.	I can't, I can't.
No way my Gino did that.	He was in the shop.
So what?	I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
His feelings?	Yea but.
I'm not going to let you.	No, no Kramer.
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.	I don't want you to call him.
So I still haven't heard about that job.	Yeah that's a tough one.
I have an idea.	Yeah?
I show up.	What do you mean you show up?
I show up.	Hmm.
Yeah, so?	Yeah, I see what you mean.
00.	So what did you do there all day?
They gave me the Pensky file.	So it's a nice place to work?
I feel like a family.	What about your boss?
He'll be back on Monday.	Hi.
Hi.	I got a haircut.
Oh yeah?	Oh there's nothing to see.
Come on.	Forget it.
Come on.	All right.
All right.	Alright, that's very good.
I'm sorry.	Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.	Yeah, but how am I.
Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair.	Oh.
I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.	Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
I don't think Uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.	That's nice of you to say.
It looks very familiar.	In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
Yeah.	Yeah.
I told you he could do it.	Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
Yeah, so?	I think he knew.
No.	Who do you know?
Listen you're just imagining things.	Okay, okay.
What happened?	He didn't get to finish it.
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.	Take the Kman.
He knows.	How do you know?
Because I know.	Who is it?
He was in the shop with Enzo.	All right, go in the bedroom.
All right, go in the bedroom.	What do you want?
Can I use your bathroom?	What's wrong with yours?
My toilet's clogged.	You can't unclog it?
No.	Did you ask Kramer?
He's out.	Number one?
Yes, yes.	All right.
No.	All right?
Yeah, yeah.	All right, I'll see you later.
What are you doing?	I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
Oh, can I watch a little?	Yeah all right.
Yeah all right.	You want something to drink?
No.	If you want to watch, sit down.
Oh, Kramer.	I don't get this Scissorhands.
I don't get this Scissorhands.	Who is it?
Enzo Manginero.	Oh my god, he knows.
It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.	No I wasn't there.
Don't lie.	Sample?
It isn't?	No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.
Get out!	Not since June 29, 1980.
You remember the date?	Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th.
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.	But you like your Joel Rifkin.
Yeah.	Ask him to change it.
You can't ask a person to change their name.	Why not?
Would you change yours?	If someone asked me nicely.
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle?	Yeah.
You think I should have asked George?	Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
Karen?	Risotto.
Oh!	Yeah.
I tought you didn't like double dates.	George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase.
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.	He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.
And you're taking.	Jody the masseuse.
Hey, did you get a massage yet?	No!
Jerry, she gives massages all day.	Yeah I know.
So what?	So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots.
Yeah.	My neck is killing me.
I'm learning a lot about you tonight George.	It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
Can we go?	Yeah.
So soon?	Yeah.
Really, how?	I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side.
So what's the deal with your friend George?	No deal.
What was all that "attractive women not getting tickets" nonsense?	Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.	Yeah.
Did you see the way that he was eating?	Yeah, he's disgusting.
I have to tell you, I really don't like him.	Yeah, me either.
It's just I hate that type.	Yeah, he's a bad seed.
Now you however, you, I like.	What are you doing?
She stayed over?	Yeah.
The sex wasn't so good?	No.
So?	I want the massage!
Did you ask her?	I tried putting her hands there  but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
Why not?	I guess 'cause it's her job.
So we had a good time.	Yeah.
We all got along.	Yeah.
What did Jodi say?	She had a good time.
Is that it?	Pretty much.
Did she say anything about, uh.	What?
You just hesitated.	I was blowing on the coffee.
She didn't like me?	Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
So she doesn't like me?	No.
She said that?	Yes.
She told you she doesn't like me!	Yes.
UhHuh  Why didn't she like me?	Not everybody likes everybody!
I tried to be nice.	You were very nice!
I bent over backwards for that woman!	It has nothing to do with her sister.
You vomited in 1987.	Oh no.
Oh no.	Jodi.
Ha!	What are you doing here?
I was giving Kramer a massage.	Kramer!
Please give it to me.	I'll see you tonight.
Hey!	Who told you to get a massage from her.
First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds.	So you had a good time.
Oh.	Enjoyed yourself.
Very.	All right now you listen and you listen good!
What!	The massages are out!
Why?	Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
Wait a minute!	I'm sorry, Kramer.
Why?	Don't you ever talk about her like that!
But why?	That's final!
Oh, God.	What's the matter with you?
Jerry, I need another massage!	You just had one yesterday.
Because of the Giant game!	Oh please.
And then the gamewinning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows!	Well, did you get the ball?
Oh I got the ball.	Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
Well, It's quite a thrill.	Why don't you get somebody else?
Because nobody does it like she does.	Well, that's it!
What about my massage?	Ask Newman.
Hey.	Hi.
Hi.	Ah, no problem.
What's with this music?	That's new age music.
What are you doing?	Just checking it out.
Actually, I should get a new one.	No, nonsense.
So, where do you wanna go?	Go?
No.	Why, what's wrong?
No, I can't!	Come on!
No means no.	Look, who are you kidding?
Listen.	Fine.
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?	What for?
We need to talk.	You need to talk?
Look it's no secret what's going on between us.	George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
Jerry.	What?
She just dislikes me so much.	I can see that.
I'm getting out of here.	Don't worry.
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.	You're a lucky guy.
I got to go after her.	George.
JODI!	The swedish are very big massagers.
Dandruff?	Yeah, that's part of it.
There's some kasha.	Yeah.
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.	You're not allowed to have people over?
Wow!	I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
Come on!	What's the big rush?
I'm having people over.	Who?
The girls for poker night.	Eh, eh, ah.
Yeah.	Really?
I'll put in a good word for you.	Thanks, because I would really like.
Aaahh!	Alright, I'm sorry.
But Jerry, this is not coming out!	Just put a coffee table book over it.
Alright, we'll take the subway.	There you go.
Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.	I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
I need something to read on the subway.	Here, read this.
He's not?	Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.
Why?	Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home.
Can't hurt you.	What about, what about this thing?
The Indian?	Yeah.
Well, they do now.	Alright, I'll take it.
Jerry!	Surprise!
What is this?	Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
Hi JerryHello.	Hi.
No.	I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature.
AwwThat's so sweet.	Are you ready?
Yeah.	Tada!
Tada!	It's a cigar store Indian.
That's very nice.	Read it out loud.
I, I don't think so.	We had a little fight this afternoon.
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona.	Heyyah, hoah, heyyah, hoah.
Winona is a Native American.	She is?
Who is it?	Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
Yeah?	Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise.
It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.	And well it should be.
I guess I could go for a bite.	You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood.
Why must I know?	I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
Oh, hello American Joe.	I didn't know that.
You know, it's late.	I, I had no idea.
Looks pretty good.	Yeah, did a good job.
Yeah.	You know, I don't get it.
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh.	Ah, she kinda calmed down.
Oh, great.	Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable.
Hello Jerry.	Hello.
I'm missing TV Guide volume fortyone, number thirtyone.	Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
I didn't know she took it!	Wa, it's two weeks old.
He collects them.	You collect TV Guide?
I don't know, uh.	I'll see you later.
So, where are we gonna go eat?	I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
Ooh, I love that place, but it's usually so crowded.	Ah, don't worry.
You made what?	I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations.
How did you get these?	Got 'em on the street, from a scal.
From who?	A uh, one of those guys.
What guys?	You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the soldout events.
Oh.	Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
That's Al Roker.	Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen.
Sure, take it.	Thanks.
Thanks.	So, Winona had the TV Guide.
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?	Yeah.
He collects  these?	Yeah.
Wow!	What'ya do with the one you took?
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.	I thought it was a pretty good idea.
Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a builtin coaster.	Where you going?
Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores.	My Indian?
I like your place.	Well, why would I assume.
Oh, by the way.	Why?
Jerry, I really need it back.	You can't give something and then take it back.
What?	A uh, a person that uh.
You mean like, an Indian giver?	I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
He does?	I don't know why we didn't think of this before.
I dunno.	Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy.
I guess.	What's the matter?
What d'you think is the matter?	It is a good idea, Elaine.
Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.	You want a gyro?
He's not?	I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come.
I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come.	You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation.
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.	Then he asked you out?
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.	On your heart?
Jerry, the man is a doctor.	Doctor?
So, its the same thing.	Anyone can get into podiatry school.
Hello.	Oh hi.
Are you going to be stopping by later?	Yes, Ill be stopping.
Ok, see you later.	See you later.

Lobster.	Looks like a swan.
Latvian Orthodox?	Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox?

Mmm, this is delicious.	Mmm, succulent.
I cant.	To Latvian Orthodox?

Ahu hu hu hu.	You told Testikov,  that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War What Is IT Good For?
Uhhu.	Can I take a guess?
Oh, Please.	Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
What, how did you know that?	Because I know who has it.
How did you find it?	Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
Where is it, give it to me!	I don't have it!
Why not.	Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
But I didn't do it.	How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
One million.	Well that's a start.
But enough about fish, huhuhu.	You know what room Testikov's in?
Yeah, 308.	Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
Why are you so interested  you want to take her out?	Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!

Told me to "Go to hell!	All right lets go.
What, are you in a bad mood?	Ahhh got my laundry back.
Ohhh!	He didn't make it.
I'm sorry.	Yea.
Yep.	Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination?
Hum!	Yeah.
Oh no, I've had just enough.	Ah, here we go.
No thanks.	You're not gonna have any?
No, it's not that.	Well, at least taste it.
No.	Come on, try it!
Come on, try it!	She wouldn't so much as taste it.
Did she say why?	No.
Maybe she's diabetic.	No.
Maybe you said something that offended her.	The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
Like at the airport?	Yeah.
That's a great idea!	Tell me about it!
We could be zipping all over the place.	They could at least try it.
They never try anything.	What's the harm?
No harm!	I'm sorry.
Who wouldn't taste a pie?	Audrey.
Dump her.	Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie?
I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.	You did?
I got a pebble.	Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
Rinitze.	Uh.
Are you gonna need this?	Keep it.
I don't know.	Uh.
That's right.	And you waved it away.
Right.	Did you give her a reason?
Yes, I was full.	You were full.
No, I'm not a psycho.	Exactly.
Jerry, how about you?	I think you know my policy.
I thought George was meeting us here?	No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.	I can't beleive your father owns this place.
Everything is delicious.	You've tasted them?
Umhmm, I think almost all of them.	Oh I see they have apple pie.
Mmmhmm.	You've had the apple pie?
Many times.	Audrey, I got to be honest with you.
Can we drop this?	Why can't I know?
Don't fill up on the bread.	The pies.
Jerry are you OK?	Huh?
Is anything wrong?	No, Nothing.
Why didn't you just tell her?	I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father.
How could he not have washed?	Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit.
Yeah, just like I do.	You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals.
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems.	We haven't spoken.
The last time I saw her, she was naked.	Yeah, and Poppie's got problems.
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin.	Yeah, all right.
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time.	Hum.
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.	Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
Oh!	Georgio!
You're telling me.	Did you hear something?
Yeah, like a swoosh.	Yeah.
I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise.	So what?
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut.	So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy.	You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.	Audrey?
Yep.	Was it apple?
What else?	This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
The mannequin!	Oh, I got to see this thing.
Oh, I got to see this thing.	Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
Yeah?	Well, I believe there's some legal precedent  Winchell vs.
Jerry get the car.	What are you doing?
Just get the car!	Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.	I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum.
That's right.	Hello.
What are you doing here?	So how was the pie?
I'm very busy here.	Pretty good, wasn'it?
Board of health, we've had several complaints.	Oh, about the.
What do they want from Poppie?	Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.	So you didn't get the job.
No.	Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
What am I supposed to say?	Tell her you lost your itch.
I lost it two days ago.	Well you should tell her.
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?	No.
It's just not good, it's not good.	It's not good.
I'm bored.	Well at breakfast everybody reads.
No.	You read during lunch?
There's nothing to talk about.	Ya, what's there to talk about.
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.	Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
She knows there is nothing to talk about.	At least you'll be talking.

Hey hey hey hey hey hey.	What?
Your parents are going to Paris right?	Yea?
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time.	What about little Joey?
Who?	Ah, I think he's probably better off.
Why are you doing this?	He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Why?	Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
Mmm  I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.	Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight,  we have plans.	What plans?
We have plans.	Where'd you get plans?

Oh.	ah no, I got the machine.

Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.	Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?	That's right.

So are they coming tonight or not?	Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
Ok, fine.	What is that anyway?

You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.	Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
NI know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people.	It is a tad askew.

Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.	So what are you going to do?
I don't know, I don't know what to do.	Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?	Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
Yea why not?	I was kind of um  making out.
You were making, out during Schindler's List?	I couldn't help it.
During Schindler's List?	We're both living with our parents.
Did anybody see you?	No I don't think so.
Oh ho right.	Hi  What?
How could you?	How could I what?
You were making out during Schindler's List?	What?
Don't lie Jerry.	Newman.
How could you do such a thing?	I couldn't help it.
I couldn't help it.	Hello.
Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.	Hang on a second.
Tomorrow afternoon?	Tomorrow afternoon?
Alright alright, goodbye.	Wwhat do you mean you're not making the flight?
A mouse!	You want the tickets?
Yes.	You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's HallofFame, I mail my own postcards.	You know I'm paying for these tickets.
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses.	Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
Just watch me do my thing.	Say Dad,  isn't that one of yours?
Bonjour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.	Dad isn't that your charter group?
Thank you.	I think she meant me, but.
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.	Ok.
Bye.	Bye.
No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.	You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.
They'll get dehydrated on the plane!	Hi Mr.
I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter.	Why what did I do?
You know very well.	Rachel!
Good night!	Rachel!
Aahh,  Get Out!	The broken window, Klompus never fixed it.
Oohh, boy.	Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
You know what drove me crazy about him?	No I hadn't noticed.
Pair of bear claws please.	Hiya Newman.
Hello Jerry.	Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
Ohh, were you there?	Yes I was.
Iit's a it's a.	Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?
Shocking.	Yes, well that was nothing.
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!	Yeah, that's real interesting.
Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.	You don't know?
Well, I don't know about "gold.	Oh, that's gold, baby.
'Baby'?	I was saying 'baby' way before George!
Yeah, who's he?	He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly .
Hey, are you performing tomorrow?	Yeah.
Great, I'm gonna bring Toby.	Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed.
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?	Yeah.
She's got a kid?	Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
Well, it's a possibility, like you said!	Hey, Ronnie.
Hey.	Can I have a club soda?
Yeah.	Yeah.
You know Leonard Christian's here?	Yeah, I know.
Can I ask you something?	I don't.
Are you sure?	I don't.
Is it possible for nostrils to expand?	Oh, is this a bit?
Hey, Jerry.	Hey.
This is so exciting!	Really!
You are so funny!	Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
What about you?	Good, good.
So, you up next?	Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?	Yeah.
Oh, have a great show.	O.
Oh, he's so great!	Men definitely hit the remote button more than women.
Oh, really!	Yes, yeah.
BOO!	Yea, ya, so.
Hey.	Hey, what's the deal?
Look, she didn't mean anything.	Well, what is the matter with her?
She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!	Hey!
Me?	YYou boo me?
Oh, come on!	No!
Well, that's the way I express myself.	Oh, I can take it.
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.	Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
No, her too.	Really?
Yeah.	You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
Yeah.	Hmm.
To some degree.	So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
In a manner of speaking.	Yeah, well, it's honest.
Yeah.	Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
Perhaps.	So, what was the fire?
Yeah.	By the way, did you see this?
What's that?	It's the Leonard Christian article about my show.
Wow, he really does a number on you.	I should have let her have it!
You know what you oughta do.	Yeah, right.
I'm not kidding, you should do it.	But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge?
Well, go ahead!	Why can't I?
No reason!	You know what?
This is unprecedented!	There's no precedent, baby!
What.	Hey, nice shoes.
You know, I have work to do here!	Oh, is this disruptive?
Well, how would you like it if I called security?	Security?
Hey, what's going on?	Boo!
What's happenin' here?	Hiss!
What did you go up there to heckle her for?	Because she came down to the club and heckled me!
Oh, YEAH!	Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
Yeah.	You kept makin' all the stops?
Oh well, I could use some coffee.	She got the promotion?
Yep.	Why?
I'll tell ya why.	Too bad.
Sure, the pinky toe is cute!	Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'weeweewee all the home.
I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?	Damn right!
How could you do that?	Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks.	Yeah, well, it won't be long.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!	Gotta go.
O.	I mean, Bozo the Clown.
Nostrils.	George  could I have a word?
All right, get off at the next exit.	Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
It's a great house, pool, sun deck?	You sure we're makin' the right move?
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.	Didn't they just have a baby?
That was two years ago, remember?	Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?	No.
Put that on the top of your list.	No, not for me.
When's Rachel comin' out?	She's makin' the three o'clock train.
What's that?	It's kind of a stuffed meat thing.
Hey Jerry.	Who are you, Mrs.
Come on, I'll rub some on yours.	No, that's no sweet'ning the deal.
'Kay.	No thanks.
I'm gonna take a dip.	And then there's Maude.
Look at my face, look at it.	No lines.
You know why?	So when are we gonna see this baby?
No thanks.	Oh this is interesting.
What?	Jane's topless.
Yo yo ma.	Boutros BoutrosGhali.
Come on, you guys.	Oh, in a minute, Carol.
We're gonna be right there.	This is weird wild stuff.
You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.	Oh, here she comes.
I'm thirsty.	No thanks.
Oh, gorgeous, yes.	So very gorgeous.
Michael, shut the door!	Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
Uh, I couldn't look.	Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool.
Oh, you have to lie.	It's a must lie situation.
Yes, it's a must lie situation.	You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
No, I don't think so.	In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
Uh, Sure.	Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
Yeah, see ya.	Okay.
Train was so crowded.	Oh I like that.
What kind of a greeting was that?	She's got greeting problems.
Yeah.	Well, the tomato's an anomaly.
Hey!	You got lobster for everybody?
Yeah, I saw Jane topless.	All right.
You saw Jane topless?	Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
Oh you mean face down on her chest.	No.
Face up on her back?	Yeah.
I can't believe that you saw her before me.	Think of me as a doctor.
Well, how good a look did you get?	Well what'd you mean?
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist.	They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
Great, great.	I guess that's true.
Stop it, stop it!	What do you want me to do?
Yes, yes!	You can see me naked.
Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.	I've never been called breathtaking either.
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?	Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
Yeah, right, that's a possibility.	How are you gonna do that?
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.	You might have.
I didn't.	You won't.
What'd you want anyway, George?	Yes, George.
No, I was just wondering.	Oh!
Strange man.	Wait'll you get to know him.
So where is this baby, anyway?	Oh, check it out.
Did she do it on purpose?	It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
I was supposed to see her.	So what?
Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind.	But.
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool.	Oh.
Yes.	So you feel you were short changed.
Yes!	Well, so what's the difference?
What if she discusses it with Jane?	Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
How do you know?	Women aren't like us.
They're worse!	No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage.
How do women know about shrinkage?	Isn't it common knowledge?
No.	Like when a man goes swimming.
It shrinks?	Like a frightened turtle!
No!	No, you don't wanna do that.
Yeah, finish eating.	Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
What is it with you?	Easy big fella.
Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice.	You told her?
Yeah, what's the big deal?	You don't understand.
I just heard a car drive out.	Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night.
You're right, I would have.	Hey, look at this guy.
A little breakfast.	Yeah.
Yes, I do.	Geez, these are delicious.
Not that much.	Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.	I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?	They got some sort of program.
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.	Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
You really oughtta do something about that cold.	You got a raise?
I don't fool around,  baby!	I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.	Oh, when did that happen?
They're signing the papers next week.	Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.	Boy, you're on quite a streak.
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.	Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.	Speaking of having it all .
I went to the beach.	Oh, the beach.
It's not working, Jerry.	What is it that isn't working?
Why did it all turn out like this for me?	Could I get napkin over there?
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.	If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
I'm Victoria.	Are you kidding?
Hey.	What's happening?
The coffee table book.	Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
You know what this means?	You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
Oh, you better believe it!	I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
No, no, no.	What're you gonna talk about?
Well, coffee tables.	Hello?
Lost 15.	Broke even.
We'll be right back in a moment.	So it's all over?
Yeah, it got pretty nasty.	And what did you go back for?
It's not like I went across the street.	Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
What's all this?	Played cards last night.
Oh yeah?	Broke even.
Do you have twenty bucks?	What for?
Just gimme twenty bucks.	What the hell was that?
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.	You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
Hey, I just found twenty dollars!	Bad.
Yes!	So you just did the opposite of everything?
Yes.	So I guess your Messiah would be the AntiChrist.
Yes funny  let's go.	Elaine .
Well, let's see.	I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is.
I suppose.	Oh, come on, that's a huge feature.
Jerry .	Yes?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.	Uh huh?
Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.	Oh, that's okay.
What?	Nah, that's fine.
You will?	Sure.
Huh?	It's fine.
Yeah, you too.	She'll be coming around the mountain.
She'll be coming around the mountain.	The New York Yankees?
The New York Yankees!	Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle .
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary.	I can't believe it.
Ya!	Ya?
It's me.	Come on up.
I'm back in business, baby!	George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
Hey!	Hi Elaine.
Hi.	How're things going?
How're things going?	Why?
I don't know!	The jewel thief?
Yeah, the jewel thief.	What else?
Stick .	Elaine, don't get too down.
I .	Is that the end of it?
Yeah, it's the last one.	Alright.
Jerry, did you hear this?	He knows what he's doing.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.	Opposite.
I must've had at least eight in my mouth.	Why'd you have to eat so many?
Because they're Jujyfruit.	Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
Do you know what's going on here?	Don't say that.
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much.	Ah .
Oh, you want one?	Yeah.
I'll get it.	That's alright, I got it.
Jerry!	Elaine, stop it.
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money.	I'm sorry.
Ooh, I gotta check my machine.	Oh, she worked at Doubleday.
Yeah, she was an editor.	Right, just like you.
No, thanks.	Ah.
Rhode Island.	I was almost Mr.
Miss Rhode Island?	Tonight.
What if she becomes Miss America?	The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
Chaperone?	No, it's part of the contest rules.
What does the chaperone do?	I don't know, she just sits there.
Can she talk?	I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk.
You're calling her?	Yeah.
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?	Of course, they're polyester.
Well, what is that?	Why do they wear polyester?
I don't know.	You're going to do something about it?
I was a great admirer of Mrs.	Hello, Karen?
Nothin.	I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
What state?	Rhode Island.
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.	Look, do you want to go or not?
Hmm.	Congratulations!
Yeah!	Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
I attend to his personal affairs.	Like what?
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh.	Really!
Yeah.	Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear!
So, what do you think?	Listen.
No way!	What?
AAAH!	But wait a minute.
As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger.	That's a hell of a plan.
What advice would you give young people?	Alright, Kramer!
Well, take you for example.	Hey, come on!
Oh, yeah.	I'll be right back.
That makes sense.	Well, here we are.
Hey.	Well, if it isn't Mr.
Oh, come on.	And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
Oh, you're poopooing!	Yes, I poopoo.
Well, let me tell you something.	I don't want to stop her!
You can't stop her, Jerry!	Yeah, so do you.
Well, did you see it?	See what?
The uniforms!	Boy, they really do sound comfortable.
Hey, where ya goin'?	I'm working in Atlantic City.
Really!	Yeah.
Atlantic City?	You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her.
Hello?	Hi, Mr.
Sorry.	Hey Elaine, it's me.
Jerry?	We're going to Atlantic City.
Really?	Today, right now!
I can't go.	Why not?
Hey.	Hey.
How was the show?	Good.
I won fifty bucks!	Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr.
I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!	What the hell is that?
Me either.	Wait a second.
Well, that's it!	What?
Her birds are dead.	Birds?
Yeah, birds.	What are you looking at?
You killed them, didn't you?	No, you don't understand  it's not what you think!
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't!	Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened.
What was that all about?	Oh, it was just Kramer.
And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!	I heard those doves were really incredible.
That's a shame.	It's like watching an animal get tortured.
Hey, hey!	Oh, great!
Oh my God, Mattingly just split his pants!	That's a shame.
Okay,  Move along.	Why did you give him MY number?
I think he's got ideas.	I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?	Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?	Why does Mr.
Hi Jerry.	Hi Julie.
Hey, wanna get some lunch?	Just had a big bowl of Kix.
No, no, Hey I'll get it.	Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
Maybe I should just get married.	Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
I know.	People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
You can say that again.	It's embarrassing for them.
Good for you.	I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Right on baby.	What was that?
Umph, sorry!	Certainly are.
He LOST IT!	All right.
Oh, thank you.	Hello.
I told ya'.	He doesn't even care if a man answers.
Did you see what just happened?	Well, that all depends.
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?	Yeah, so?
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad.	Is that a fact?
Yes it is.	No it isn't.
I mean I'm the one who bought it.	Yes you did.
You think she should have said something?	She could have.
Oh, I know.	Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.	Obviously.
Turn on the TV.	What?
Jerry .	Well, it has nothing to do with you.
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.	Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner.
There is no problem.	And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
Well, they haven't even arrested him yet.	Ah, no , I don't think so.
Why not?	We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Who is staring?	Oh, they're staring.
Oh, they're staring.	Hello.
Hello.	Hello Newman.
Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.	No, no I don't.
You know, Genderson.	I suppose.
What did Kramer say?	I don't know.
Hello.	You two know each other?
Just a few times.	Why?
I liked him.	You liked, Newman?
Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?	No, I'm sorry.
YES!	No, no of course not.
Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.	What tee?
A golf tee.	Newman!
It must be a mistake.	No.
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.	No, there's less.
It's possible.	No it isn't.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.	Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
Would you like some more coffee?	No,, but thank you.
No,, but thank you.	Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
Ugh!	No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.	Well, what did you do that for?
To please Mr.	Well, you better go down there and tell this guy.
Uh, great!	Hi Julie.
Hi Julie.	Hi.
Hi Julie.	Hi, how are you, Elaine?
Who is it.	It's Jerry.
You've come at a bad time now.	Come on Newman.
Hellooo Jerry.	Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games.
There's no need to get excited.	No, we can't.
Do you really want to know what happened?	Noit your type?
Not really.	Well, how come?
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.	What, what is wrong with her?
Well, h ha ha if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.	You don't think she's attractive?
No.	Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.
Care for some lemonade?	No, thank you.
Because that's the way I weas raised.	What are you so worried about this for?
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?	He did?
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.	No, I don't think so.
Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.	Hey, let me ask you a question.
Hey, let me ask you a question.	Yeah, and the curls.
Oh, I love curls.	Yeah,, me too.
All right, I'll see you later.	Where you going?
Genderson's.	You're going to see Genderson?
I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day.	You had how many dates with him?
Around three.	And .
I told you.	What?
What?	Why are you looking at my face?
Why are you looking at my face?	Where am I going to look?
Newman!	All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was Newman found this unacceptable.
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.	You're going out with the stationery store guy?
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything.	Hello, what?
She was hitting on you?	Your friend, Noreen.
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?	If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.	If you don't believe me, ask her.
I will.	Oh, right.
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?	Check the pile.
Oh, who sent you a card?	I don't know.
Open it, it's from Hallmark.	Oh.
Hello, darling.	Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
Who's Kristin?	She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
Giddyup!	No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work.
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?	Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
You know what I'm doing?	Oh, go ahead.
You sure you don't mind?	Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
Uh oh.	So was I right?
Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.	Oh, I know you are.
You got the card I sent?	I did.
So where is it?	What?
The card.	No?
Fine.	Why, because I threw the card out?
You have no sentimentality.	I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental.
Oh, so you save her cards but not mine!	Well, but, you see, I saved something!
New cards, huh?	No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
Oh.	Yeah.
Oh, a check.	Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
There's a check in all these?	I don't know, it's ten dollars.
But you got a whole pile here.	Oh so what.
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift.	Oh, get out of here.
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.	Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.
Yeah.	It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive.
The rule is a minimum of two days.	You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
I'm making it up.	I mean really, what's the point of saving it?
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.	Absolutely.
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.	So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.	Could you?
Alright.	Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
I should never have made that phone call.	Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
Yes, she's very upset.	So was I right about the flirting?
Who was flirting with you?	Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
She wasn't flirting with you.	Oh, sure she was Asked me where the 'humor' section was?
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.	Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me.
Yeah.	Why does he do that?
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers.	Oh, you know.
Did you see the way she pointed at the check?	That's how waitress types express derision.
You know, maybe George has something here about PBS.	Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.	Boy, you really came through.
Absolutely.	Excuse me?
Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.	You're just answering phones!
Oh, you're getting it , it comes with your breakfast special.	Right you are.
I don't believe it, she did it again!	Oh, she had an itch.
She had an itch.	By the way, lunch is on me.
Oh dear.	Hello?
Jerry?	Uncle Leo!
Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.	Nana's missing?
I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here.	I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
What kind of checks?	I think Chemical Bank.
Chemical?	Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy.
Your grandmother's on a very fixed income.	Just call me if you hear anything.
Well, don't look at me.	It's your fault!
And now I think she might really be interested in you.	Would you?
Any word from Nana?	No.
Nana?	Yeah, my grandma's missing.
Missing?	Yeah.
Um, what does Nana sound like?	Like a grandmother, why?
Well.	Oh, you hung up on my Nana?
I don't know, maybe.	You told Nana to drop dead?
It's possible.	Yes, it is!
Alright, alright.	Alright.
Jerry, where are all the tote bags?	I don't know.
Jerry, this man wants to see you.	Leo?
Hello.	Uncle Leo!
I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.	Oh.
Jerry, I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull.	He'll be here any second.
You know you guys are both on in five minutes.	Yeah, yeah.
Why didn't you tell me you were a little short?	No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
Jerry, would you please take it.	I can't, I can't take it.
I want you to have it!	Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
Jerry, take the money!	I don't want it!
Who's that?	You know what?
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS?	programs like Ken Burns' Baseball.
Jerry?	My Nana?
She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income!	I got another card from Kristin.
Wow.	Yes, he is.
You should show this to Georgie.	Yeah.
Here's your knife and fork.	Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
I just don't get it.	You know, I saw someone on the street eating MMs with a spoon.
What is wrong with everybody?	Look, they're doing it.
Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags really I'm fine.	I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little.
Can we rest here a second.	Yeah, I guess.
Mmm!	Already?
No, but.	A Long Talker.
Yeah!	All right let's move it out.
All right let's move it out.	Hey, isn't that George's father?
Oh, yeah, it is!	I've never seen him in Manhattan before it's weird.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?	I believe he is wearing a cape.
Why is Mr.	Well, it is good cape weather.
Yeah, why a cape?	You're right it is strange.
You're right it is strange.	Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.	Oh!
That sounds urgent.	Let me call him back.
Donna Chang?	I should've talked to her I love Chinese women.
Isn't that a little racist?	If I like their race, how can that be racist?
If I like their race, how can that be racist?	So listen.
A lot!	I got a date!
With the Chinese woman?	She knew who I was!
Jerry.	No, why should I?
You ever get a woman pregnant?	I'm sorry, Kramer.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?	Really?
A LOT of 'em!	Well, I'm sure you're not.
Yeah but what if I am?	So go to a fertility clinic.
All right.	I am very excited about this date!
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?	She suggested it!
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese.	She's very assimilated.
She's very assimilated.	Paul again?
Hey, hey, hey!	I tried!
Was my father wearing a cape?	No.
Please let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.	Yes, I will.
Do you mind?	No, go ahead, I secondhand smoke two packs a day.
Jerry.	'scuse me?
Hi.	Who are you?
I'm Donna Chang.	Wwhat do you mean?
I mean I'm Donna Chang.	You're Donna Chang?
Did you think I was Chinese?	Oh.
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.	I didn't think so.
She's not Chinese?	No.
So.	Well, she's.
Oh, how disappointed you must have been.	Well, it's false advertising, see?
So then why are you seeing her again.	Well, she is a woman.
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen.	Really?
Well, maybe.	Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
What do you mean?	Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.
Whoa!	Here, what is that?
Look, you gotta help me.	Whayou have a low sperm count?
Very low!	NnnooI don't want 'em.
Jerry, look!	Look!
All it takes is one pair!	I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
What am I gonna do!	Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
How could Jerry not say Hello?	Did they uncross the lines yet?
No, they can't find the problem.	Did you say, "ridicurous"?
Ridiculous.	I thought you said.
Did you say, "The rines are crossed?	Did I?
Ay, divorced.	Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago.
Oh my God!	Gee, I never thought of that.
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?	Have you ever spent any time with these people.
The man in the capeI bet you he is mixed up in this!	And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape.
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time.	Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers.
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.	You went back to the Jockeys?
Wrong again.	Oh, no.
What?	Don't you see what's goin' on here?
Eeaawww.	The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine.
Oh, it be so.	Don't you need a little.
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me!	What are you doin' to this woman?
Well.	So she breaks up with him.
I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.	Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!	Yeah.
It's Donna Chang.	Come on up.
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it.	Well, let's look back at your history with this woman.
Okay.	First, you encouraged her to join the army.
She was lost.	Then, you suggest she goes.
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun.	You know.
Hi.	Oh, Miss Changstein!
Oh.	Why?
She said you should come too.	Tonight?
It was that Chinese woman.	So I'm curious.
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.	Confucius, huh?
Yeah.	You know, you're not Chinese.
You know, you're not Chinese.	Hey!
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?	Elaine was.
You want a divorce?	You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name.
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!	WellNoreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.
huuh,  You know, everybody listens to the Chinese.	Yeah, no one's reading any rolledup messages in a knish.
Oh, it had to happen!	Hey.
I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer.	So, she got you to join a book club?
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.	Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence.
Nah, I don't like that one.	So, what's your first book?
"Breakfast At Tiffany's.	It's kinda old, isn't it?
He's a great writer.	Oh, yeah.
Did you ever read anything by him?	No.
Hey, what's going on?	New couch, baby!
New couch?	I love this couch.
Oh, let me get the door for you.	Wait till you see it, it's perfect.
What are you doing with your old couch?	Nothing, the moving guys are taking it.
Yeah, I'll take it.	Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
Hey!	It's here!
Ooh!	Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?
Yeah, yeah.	Yeah.
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!	What made you resurrect that old idea?
I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.	I'm not goin' there.
Well, I don't know.	Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
Did you offer those guys a drink?	Uh, no.
What kind of a person are you?	I don't know.
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?	Ah ha.
You wanna know what I said?	I can't wait.
"I do now.	Clever.
Is that something?	Yes.
Is that something?	You're something.
Well, they're real men, Jerry.	So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
Yes.	Well, would you apologize for me?
Let me show you to your table.	Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
My mother.	So, what's good tonight?
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck.	Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
Paccino's?	Why not?
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, antiabortion groups.	So, you won't eat the pizza?
No way.	Really.
Yeah.	Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.	Really!
Yeah.	Well, perhaps we should inquire.
Yes, Jerry.	Poppie, I was just curious.
When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child.	Oh, boy.
You're not welcome!	Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up.
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up.	Well, you should have seen it.
I'm sorry I missed it.	Oh, you really missed something.
Oh.	So, what's it about?
Well, it's about Holly GoLightly.	Holly GoLightly.
Yeah, she's quite a character.	Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
No.	Big surprise.
I couldn't.	You're not very bright, are you?
No, I'm not.	Why don't you rent the movie?
So.	Oh.
I don't know!	We should get him something.
I'm in looove!	Whoa!
This is it, Jerry!	Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
No, I forgot.	No games?
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know?	Ah ha.
What?	What is his stand.
Well, I'm sure he's prochoice.	How do you know?
Because he, well.	Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas.
Hey.	Hey, what's happenin.
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place.	You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
Yeah.	Okay.
Hello.	I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
That's fine.	Okay.
What is what?	This puddle on my sofa!
Are you sure?	Well, what is it then?
I'm sure it'll come out.	I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
Oh my god.	You see?
So, you're gonna get a new couch?	Well, I guess I have no choice.
Do you want your old couch back?	I was hoping you'd offer.
It's the movers.	'Kay.
Who's that?	Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.
No, no, he's not my boyfriend.	Why?
Take a guess.	Oh, really.
Hi.	Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
Today?	Could you?
What are you doing with this couch?	George is taking it.
Did you tell him it was peed on?	He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
George.	I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have.
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have.	I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
I think she finds my stupidity charming.	As we all do.
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.	Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?	You're good with the mothers.
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.	Maybe you should date the mothers.
Hey, you got a hammer?	What do you need a hammer for?
Well, I got this new poster.	Oh, yeah!
No, no, I don't have it now.	Nah, I don't think so.
Oh, COME ON!	Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
All right, I've had it with you two.	Hey, guess what?
A gymnast!	Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
A gymnast, Jerry.	Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
"Bailing"?	Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
Jerry, you should pay that price.	She's Romanian.
A gymnast!	What is this?
What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.	"Back on"?
I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".	What for?
Well, it frees me up.	Unbuttoned, or all the way off?
ALL the way, baby!	Of course.
Yeow!	What, again?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	You always take the shirt off?
Always.	Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle.
Oh, DAMN this thing!	So, Ceausescu.
Oh yes.	He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning.
And you could not refuse.	No, you'd have to be crazy.
He was a very bad dictator.	Yes.
Yes.	So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen.
No, no.	Was it in the trash?
Yes.	Then it was trash.
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.	But it was in the cylinder!
Above the rim.	Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.
It was on a magazine!	Was it eaten?
One little bite.	Well, that's garbage.
But I know who took the bite.	Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum.
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum.	Hey!
Hey.	What's with you?
I got a stone.	What stone?
A kidney stone.	What is that, anyway?
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney.	Oh, that's gotta hurt.
No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage.	Good for you.
Yes, good for me!	Y'know what you should do now?
Behold!	Kramer, are you still on this?
Jerry, what is your problem?	Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me.
All right, Jerryare you familiar with the Kama Sutra?	No.
Tantric yoga?	No.
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape?	All right.
Not yet.	Hey, that's her!
Oh yeah.	Well, here we are.
Yes.	How did you stay on that beam like that?
It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body.	Oh boy.
Oh boy.	I couldn't believe it.
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?	Well, you know.
No, what?	Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know.
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and.	You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics.
Oh, come on.	Well.
You mean like the uneven parallel bars?	See, again, I really don't feel that.
The balance beam?	Could we stop?
Not the pommel horse?	All right.
All right.	So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
I dunno, at least three weeks.	Oh, great.
Jerry, that is such small potatoes.	Between Poland and Morgan?
Yeah.	Kramer!
Kramer!	What happened, did you pass the stone?
No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield.	Strike two!
You think I'm going down?	You're behind in the count.
Hey, what are you doing later?	I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
Well, maybe you should try again.	If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
All right, where you going?	We're going to the circus.
Well, Jerry, it's your obligation.	Yeah, well, y'know what?
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.	Yeah, well you're going.
So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?	"Greatest Show on Earth"!
My father used to take me to the circus.	Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
It is time.	Well, break a leg.
Well, break a leg.	Eh, show biz.
Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha!	Boy, those capes are really coming back.
Oh, sorry I took so long.	What is that sound?

Why should she like me?	The omelet.
Maybe she could like me?	No.
No.	Not possible.

Actually it was great.	Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
All this in 5 days.	Oh no, it's Kenny Bania.

Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation.	Well let me ask you this.
Or something.	Or something.
There you go.	Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
What do you mean?	Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
I think things were going ok.	Uh huh.
I mentioned how I liked horse manure.	You did?
Yeah.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Mmhm.
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing.	And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?	My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
Hey.	Aaa.
It's all fresh.	Well Im glad it's working out.
Oh yeah, it's working out.	Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
Ha ha ha ha.	Is she?

You worn the suit yet?	No, not yet.
Oh, get the swordfish.	Ill have the salmon.
Ahh, you know what I think.	Another time?

Soup's not a meal.	Im not stopping you from eating.
But I don't want anything but soup.	Then that's the meal.
But I had the hot dog.	I didnt tell you to have a hot dog.
Hey, I give you a brandnew Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?	All right, fine.
All right, fine.	So he just gets soup.
What kind of soup did he get?	I don't know?
Consomm, hmm.	What?
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry.	Elaine you're missing the whole point.
What?	The meal is the act of sitting down with him.
Was it a cup or a bowl?	You see  ah, uh .
Im just curious.	A bowl, ok?
Did he crumble, any crackers in it?	As a mater of fact, he did.
Oh, well.	It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
No.	Well, I have some money.
Pardon?	So is she working?
Yeah, yeah, she's here.	Have you said anything to her?
No, but Im very uncomfortable.	Are you going to say anything?
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.	Ill have an egg white omelet.
What's it gonna be?	Yeah, that was bad.
Did you feel that tension?	Oh, no, it's Kenny.
Hey.	Hey.
You worn the suit yet?	Actually, I did.
What kind of soup do you have?	Why don't you get a sandwich?
Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.	OK .
OK .	This is the meal .
What are you talking about?	Yes it is.
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.	I tried to do that.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.	Hi.

So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.	Look at this.
Hello.	Oh, hi Hilde.
Did you read the menu?	All right, just give me a western.

If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!	She's on your turf.
If only she could get fired.	You're the best.
HHey.	Well, there's nothing left.
There, you see.	Why'd she get fired?
So, Simon is definitely going back now.	Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?
Hey Jerry, where's my suit?	I don't have it.
Jon Voight?	Okay, Tim.
Was that Tim Whatley?	Yes, it was.

Why?	He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy.
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy.	Uh  new car!
Ohhh!	Hey!
A LeBaron?	I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
What Consumer?	Alright.
That's right.	You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
No, no.	I think yes, yes.
Hey.	Hey.
Hey, Bogambo  they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years.	I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
Well, what about sneakers?	Alright, take 'em.
You are gonna love this car.	I like Jon Voight.
What do you mean "might"?	I don't know.
Well, why would the guy make up something like that?	Don't you see, that's the genius of it.
Neeson?	Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
Liam Neeson.	Let me get a clean pair.
You said take 'em.	Not all of 'em!
Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.	Obviously.
Jerry, I left you a pair right here.	I can't wear these!
Well, why not?	They're uncomfortable.
Where did you get those?	I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these.
Ah, you look like a cowboy!	But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
Yeah?	Oh yeah?
What?	No, nothing.
No, what is it?	No, it's just that I, uh.
So?	C'mon, put the top up, it's November!
I feel alive, Jerry.	Let's check out the glove box.
Hey.	With Jon Voight's teeth marks.
Ah!	Except Jon is spelled with an H.
So?	Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name JON?
So, what are you saying?	Nothing.
Get out of the car!	What?
Get out!	And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!
Did they take anything?	No, they didn't even touch me.
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.	You really seemed to enjoy it.
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.	Ah!
Well, I talked to Tim Whatley.	Yeah.
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?	So.
Mmmm.	Alright, but let me ask you this question.
What?	Which word did he emphasize?
I think he emphasized "would.	You know what?
Hey.	Hey, so where's my sneakers?
That's what I wanna know.	What do you mean?
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home?	So all my sneakers are gone?
I'm afraid so.	Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?
Alright, that's enough of this.	Where ya goin'?
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr.	Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
Hey!	No Jon Voight Day, huh?
No.	Yeah, it's all swollen.
You should have somebody take a look at that.	I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
You going to the party?	No, I don't know if I'm invited.
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.	Yeah, you're right.
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.	Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me.
Maybe I'll just meet you there.	You don't want to go with me?
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you.	The way I feel when I go places with you?
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away.	What?
Jon Voight bit you?	Well, what is he, a vampire?
That he did.	Oh, please.
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.	No, it's stupid.
Why?	So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewedup pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
It's worth a shot.	So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
That's right.	Hey, Elaine.
What?	Elaine, would you marry me?
I told you, I can't hear a word.	Alright.
Jerry.	Hey, Tim.
Jerry.	Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"?
Can't this wait until Monday?	Just a quick peek.
Those kids look pretty disappointed.	Especially that big kid up in the front.
Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?	Yes it is.
You don't know me, but a really strange thing happened.	Can I have the address of that garage sale?
Where are they?	Parsippany, New Jersey.
Let's go!	My car's in the shop.
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.	That's incredible.
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.	From your mother.
From your mother.	So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
Sure.	That's a 180, George.
Whatever.	Hi Willie.
Hey Jerry.	I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
What are you doing with it?	Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
Hi.	Hi.
Hey Jerry, you know my wife Donna.	Yeah, that's why I said hi.
Hey, nice jacket.	Thanks.
Whoa, this is a beauty.	Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale.	Yeah.
OK, so then I put it on at home.	So you're saying, Store  HotsyTotsy, Home HotsyNotsy.
Yeah exactly.	I thought we were going to the movies?
Hey Elaine.	Because you didnt have a job?
Perhaps.	A lesser man would have crumbled.
A lesser man would have crumbled.	It's a little .
All Right!	You got no waist in that thing.
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous.	How fast was she walking?
Demi ?	No.
Wait a minute  Wait a minute.	What?
Skinny Mirrors!	Oh, you're crazy.
Good idea.	Do it tomorrow.
It's definitely doable.	Well, that was the worst.
You got a pen?	Yeah, I think I do.
And I need something to write on.	Well, all I got is my drycleaning stub.
I gust met Uma Therman.	Uma Therman?
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now.	He's got the Kavorca.
Where?	He just went in.
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?	It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be drycleaned.
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah .	So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
Yeah.	Just a quick sidebar here  are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
Not that Im aware of, no.	So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
I didnt think ahead.	Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
I didnt say any other bawdy things.	Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
All right, you know you're not any help at all here.	All right, all right.
3 days.	It's almost a week.
It's almost a week.	Oh, My god.
What?	It's a movie stub from the 930 show.
Hey, Jerry.	No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
You came by to ask that?	Yeah.
What are you gettin at?	I saw you the other night stepping out with my HoundsTooth jacket.
I wasn't wearing your jacket.	Yeahhh, am I imagining this?
Jerry.	Yeah, Yeah.
Jerry, come on.	Now.
Now?	Yeah.
Well .	Where's that ticket?
Wait, you, you mean to tell me you don't have a ticket for the coat?	No, not on me.
Well, I, I need to see that ticket.	Why?
Yeah, but this is different.	All right, Ill be back.
Hey, what's going on in there?	Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?	What clothes?
Didnt Elaine call you?	No.
Well what are you doing here?	What am I doing here?
Oh, the stub, yeah.	Where are your pants?
Well, I sold them to Bania.	What?
What?	Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?
ouhhh  I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub.	Where are your clothes?
I told you I sold them to Bania.	You mean what you were wearing?
Yeah.	How'd you expect to get out of here?
Kramer.	Im going out.
Jerry.	Bania.
Well you're not getting any money back.	Excuse me.
Umas number is on that ticket.	Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back.
Im not going to give him 300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.	I got an idea.
What?	I cant believe Im gonna do this.
I cant believe Im gonna do this.	Bania can I talk to you for a second?
Pretty good.	Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here.
Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.	Yeah, yeah all right, well uh .
Can we go back to Mendys?	You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
Twice?	all right lets be reasonable, Bania.
Here you go.	Ohh .
Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else.	Let me in, it's me.
All right, nice work.	The drycleaning numbers are gone too.
It must have been the botanical extracts.	Give me that.
Give me that.	Hey Bania, the dinners off.
You trying to get out of Mendys?	The ticket is worthless.
You promised me.	Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?
No it's not.	It is!
Are you out of your mind?	You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.	What do you think the drycleaners is your own personal closet!
Mmm.	Yeah, it's very good.
I told you Mendys had the best pea soup.	Yeah.
Wait till you try the swordfish.	Yeah, yeah I know.
Yeah.	Oh, and who might that be?
You really like to say my name?	Excuse me Lois.
Jerry Seinfeld!	Duncan Meyers!
Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up?	Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
Huh, he's a communist.	Hi oh.
Where's Lois?	She couldn't make it.
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.	I know, finally.
Who's he?	Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George.
What's that?	Mr.
Oh, of course.	He was down at the other end.
I looked up.	By the time the race was over I had won.
Really?	And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed.
Well what happened when you raced him again?	I never did.
So now Duncan is back?	He's back.
Hi.	Hi.
Sorry I missed the Chinese food.	Oh, so am I .
He's okay.	He say anything?
About what?	Oh, nothing in particular.
He said that you got a head start.	Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
So you WERE the fastest kid in school.	Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
So you lied to her?	I couldnt tell her the truth.
Well, I'm dating a communist.	Wow, a communist.
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?	The Daily Worker has personal ads?
And they say appearance is not important.	Yours or hers?
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone.	Wow, look at you.
Yeah, right!	Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for?
What's up?	Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow.
He wants to meet you?	That's not bad.
But there's no way you could have beaten me by that much.	I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade.
That's what I've always wondered about.	Well, I .
George, George Costanza!	Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me.	This is Lois.
So what have you been doing with yourself?	I'm I'm a comedian.
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.	Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
Yeah, yeah.	You really used to have a think full head of hair.
Yeah, yeah.	yeah, yeah.
Yep.	Well you've really built yourself up into something.
Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.	Well, one cannot help but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.	Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there.
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running.	George, George, hang on.
Oh, the big race.	Yeah.
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard .	George!
But I digress.	Did I get a head start?
Head start, oh no absolutely not.	You satisfied?
That's a good idea.	No, no, no, another race  out of the question.
Race him Jerry.	All right!
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist.	Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow?
Not anymore.	Hi how are you?
I just spoke to Duncan.	What?
Yes he can.	Don't worry Lois.
How do you feel?	I need a miracle.
You ready boys?	Yes, Mr.
So will you come to Hawaii with me Jerry?	Maybe I will , Lois.
And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace.	Come on.
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr.	What's it doin here?
You know you should keep in touch.	Oh, Bruline.
Newman plays tennis?	He's fantastic.
I gotta get going.	Oh, OK.
So did you like the movie?	Yeah, it was OK.
That's funny.	I'm glad you enjoyed it.
George I need to freshen.	It was unbelievable.
See, what did I tell ya?	And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh.
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr.	I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh.
Well, I heard a noise.	What noise?
You know, .	What blah?
From the bathroom.	Oh, you think she was refunding?
Elaine, of course I'm concerned.	In a manner of speaking.
Here's your scrubber back.	Thanks.
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.	A matron?
Cosmo?	Why didn't you just ask her for it?
C'mon up.	So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr.
That's stealing?	Stealing?
It's all worked out.	What's she like?
Ah, I'm ready what?	What is it?
That's right.	We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years.
Yes?	Hi, is Sandy here?
Hi, you must be Jerry.	I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
Wow.	It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and femininenone of those big coarse "ha's.
Oh yeah HAAA, HAAA.	Yeah.
I see.	So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
The Switch?	"The Switch.
Can't be done.	I wonder.
All right, dammit, I'm in.	I couldn't do it without you.
All right.	Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding?
We'll come up with something.	Yeah, sure we will.
All right.	All right.
That's right.	And you believe this course of action will have a twopronged effect.
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work.	Huh.
You disappoint me, my friend.	It's a perfect plan.
What happened to Babs.	Ah, that's a shame.
Hey, what happened with Sandy.	Yeah, I did.
So what happened?	No actually, she took it pretty well.
So what happened?	She's into it.
Into what?	The manage.
That's unbelievable.	Oh, it's a scene man.
You're not goin to do it?	I can't.
Are you crazy?	Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy?
If only something like that could happen to me.	Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
I know.	Hey, what happened?
No, I got caught.	What do you mean you got caught?
Her assistant caught me.	I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
Hey.	Hi Cosmo.
Thanks man.	Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation.	Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
We din, we didn't .	You sure you don't want the tickets?
No thanks.	I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.	I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?	Maybe he didn't know?
Lemme see.	Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?	I asked.
Wish I could help you.	Come on, take them.
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?	What do you think?
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteenhundred bucks.	Yeah, sleeping arrangements.
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet.	Aah.
Hey, is that Tim Whatley?	The Dentist?
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?	Oh, no.
Oh good.	Yeah, I blamed it on you.
Hey Jerry!	Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
I'm getting a makeover.	Hey.
What, are you kidding?	Here.
How can I think you?	No no no.
No no no.	Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift.
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift.	Come in.
Where can I put this?	What is it?
It's Risk, Jerry.	Kramer, why do you have to  Hello, Newman.
Hello, Jerry.	Take what?
The board, Jerry.	So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.	So that's here?
Yes, yes.	I don't wanna be Switzerland.
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.	Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.
Alright, so you're gonna look after it?	Yeah, yeah.
Stay strong buddy.	Yeah.
Watch it good.	Ok.
Hey.	Hey.
Hey.	Yes it is.
Love the Label Baby, baby.	Tim Whatley?
Yeah.	One Tim Whatley!
Not, my Tim Whatley?	The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
I think this is the same one I gave him.	Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing.
Yeah, perhaps.	Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
Um, he said, "Oh.	He repeated the name of the gift?
Yeah, so?	Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
What do you mean?	Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh.
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.	Why'd you get him a gift anyway?
I'm sure I will.	Male roommate, huh?
Yes.	Is this a problem?
No.	So he's an eligible receiver.
She's confiding in him about our dates.	What's stopping them?
Exactly!	What does he look like?
Oh, that's the worst part of it.	He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
I look like me and I'm working from the outside.	Not you.
Ho ho.	We'll take a check please.
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment.	I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
I've said that before?	Many times.
Hey.	Hey.
Guess what?	So what?
The super has keys to your apartment.	Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
Yeah, alright, fine.	Are you through?
Oh.	The wedding is off?
The wedding is off.	I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.	Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving?
Well, didn't he regift the label maker?	Possibly.
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?	You may have a point.
I have a point, I have a point.	Alright, I'll call him.
Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.	Thanks.
Alright, I gotta go.	What are you gonna do about the roommate?
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him.	Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
Hello Jerry, may I come in?	What do you want?
Nothing, just being neighborly.	I'm not letting you cheat, Newman.
Jerry?	You're not a little anything, Newman.
Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?	I dunno, watch it on TV I guess.
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me.	You're going to the Super Bowl?
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.	What's his name?
Tim Whatley.	That's my ticket!
Is it?	Newman!
We'll see.	Newman.
How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?	Newman's his mailman.
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?	Who goes anywhere with Newman?
Well, he's merry.	He is merry, I'll give him that.
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.	Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
Hey, guess what?	What?
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.	What about the label maker?
Ah, well.	Wait a minute, that's my ticket!
It was totally out of the blue.	So, how did you get up there?
No.	Then how'd you get up there?
What?	That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
Why?	You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West?
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?	Obviously.
Hey.	Hey.
I'm watching your door.	My door?
Yeah, from my peephole.	What was that?
Damn!	The bedroom!
The bedroom!	I see you, Newman!
Oh.	So she kicked him out of the apartment.
That's right.	Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
I guess she did.	That's not a good role for you.
No, it's not.	You unwittingly made a major commitment.
Oh my god.	You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.	He was shouldering.
I couldn't leave well enough alone?	Where are you going?
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.	Oh, well here.
Yeah.	So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
Yeah.	Thanks for having me over, guys.
Thanks for having me over, guys.	Alright, I'll see you later.
Hey Jerry?	Ah, Tim Whatley.
Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible.	Are you serious, what about Elaine?
Oh, Elaine.	Oh.
So, I guess I'll see you at the game.	Yeah, see you there.
Oh, Elaine!	H.
Hello, Jerry.	Oh, it's enchanting.
Great streak of luck I'm having.	Can you move over at all?
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels.	An inch!
Hey!	So you called the cop a pig?
I was yelling at the litterbug.	Didn't you explain that to the cop?
No, I fled the scene.	Hey.
Right, I got news.	Oh yeah, I knew.
You knew?	He told me a few months ago.
Why did he tell you and not me?	I don't know.
So, is he okay?	Oh yeah, he's fine, fine.
Huh, really?	No, he was on his regular bed.
So why didn't you tell me?	He swore me to secrecy.
So?	It's not like you're my wife.
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.	Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing.
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.	That's right, you let him have it.
Mmmmm.	Who is he not to tell you about his lifethreatening illness?
That's what I'm saying.	His illness is your business.
If not mine, whose?	If not now, when?
You told her?	If I told you, you woulda given it away.
You don't think I can keep a secret?	No, but he would've read your face.
You don't trust my poker face?	Do you ever win at poker?
You know, we had a really bad breakup.	The Jujy Fruits?
I can't believe you did that!	I never heard her say hi.
No, no.	It's like a game of tag.
It's like a game of tag.	Where you going?
Nowhere.	You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
Yeah, well, listen.	Hey.
Fine, fine.	Really?
Yeah.	You look like something's on your mind.
No.	So, that's your poker face.
My regular face.	No it isn't.
What are you saying?	All right George, c'mon, what d'you got?
I got nothing.	What you got, a pair of bullets?
What you talking about?	Two pair?
Will you stop it?	Oh my God, you got a flush!
I don't have a flush.	A full house?
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.	So what was wrong with him?
Nothing!	So he's been lying to me for two months?
That's right.	What kind of person is this?
Well.	I don't even think you could do it.
Oh, I could do it.	Yeah, I guess you could.
You did that?	Yeah.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.	Why not?
Yeah.	Well I don't like it.
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too.	Why didn't he tell me?
Because you were being so nice.	I don't think I can be that nice.
You be nice!	Gary?
What d'you think?	Is that from my gift certificate?
Yeah buddy.	Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing?	I don't think so.
Well, what d'you know.	Okay.
Hey buddy.	Hey.
It's an eyepatch.	You look like a pirate.
I wanna be a pirate.	This is Gary.
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.	Can't see on your right side?
Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.	Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
What whip?	The Whip.
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?	Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig?
No.	Yeah.
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.	And you know what else?
The one who always sits by herself?	Yeah!
How did he do that?	Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
He picked her up?	Walked right over to her table.
I'll try some on and see how they look.	You ever see what that thing looks like in the back?
Well, some of 'em look good.	What if you get involved with a woman?
Well, what d'you think?	I, really can't say.
No, say.	It's not good, okay.
I really think this looks pretty good.	Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you.	Oh, hey, I'm being helpful.
No, I don't think you're being helpful!	Hey!
All you people with hair think you're so damn superior!	All right!
Jerry!	I'm sorry.
What?	What?
This judge has to use it for some scofflaw.	You know, Gary  I had a little chat with George the other day.
I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!	Gimme that thing!
'Scuse me.	Look at you.
I know.	You stink.
Oh.	Oh.
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?	No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
You know, I'm going as a beard.	A beard?
Yeah.	Yes.
Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?	Yeah.
You know I just thought of something.	Well what about me?
Yeah, yeah.	It sounds like an excellent idea.
Pouty?	You can't go wrong with pouty.
Oh yeah, you were right.	Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?
Well this worked out okay.	Yeah, I think I will.
Oh it was such a great night.	And did they suspect anything?
No, I was a fantastic beard.	And we discover yet another talent.
Oh it was such a great night.	You said that already.
Oh I did?	Yeah.
Oh.	Oh no.
He's incredible.	Yeah, but?
Yeah, I know.	So?
What?	Not conversion.
Well it did occur to me.	You think you can get him to just change teams?
Why?	Because when you join that team it's not a whim.
We've got a good team.	Yeah, we do.
Why can't he play for us?	They're only comfortable with their equipment.
We just got along so great.	Of course you did.
No, no, no, I sensed something.	You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.
I realize that.	Are you that desperate?
Yes I am.	So are you going to bring your gun?
So are you going to bring your gun?	What are you looking for?
Tupperware.	Sorry.
I knew this was going to happen.	What about a plastic bag?
You must be kidding.	What is the difference?
Who's to say it didn't?	So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
Yes I did.	What did you say to her?
What do you think I said?	I don't know.
I told her the truth.	As you see it?
Yes, as I see it.	Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
What hat?	You know, you're little hair hat there.
No.	Don't you think she could tell?
No, no, no she can't tell.	Are you kidding?
You only think that because you know me.	Have you noticed people staring at your head?
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.	Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
Yeah that's it.	Oh, I'll split a cab with you.
Hey that's my coffee!	Hi Sarge.
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.	What's that?
A polygraph.	Oh.
If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here.	Really.
Have you ever seen the show?	No.
You can admit it Jerry.	I admit it.
Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly.	The poly?
Melrose Place?	Yes.
I just didn't know you watched that.	Well I do.
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.	Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane.	And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
Why?	The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
That is so stupid.	It's too stupid to confess.
So what are you going to do?	I don't know.
Oh, who do you think you are?	Hey you know what?
Oh god this tastes terrible.	Did you shake it up?
No.	You gotta shake it up.
No.	Yeah, that's a real nuisance.
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.	So tonight are you going to make the move?
Yeah, I think I might.	Hey there he is.
That's an interesting question.	How so?
What do you think I mean bald?	She's bald?
Let me tell you something.	Women go bald?
Yeah, I've heard of that.	Hey.
And you know what else I've decided to do?	She's as good as anybody else.
Her scalp was clean.	Yeah you've had like a religious awakening.
Going to need a little more coffee here.	So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.	Come on, you've got the gift.
Jerry, I can't.	All right, well I've got to go take this test.
Hey, I did it.	What?
I turned him.	Get out!
Because I'm a woman.	Elaine, do you know what you've done?
What's your name?	Jerry Seinfeld.
What is your address?	129 West 81st street.
Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?	I don't know.
Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend?	I don't know.
Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas?	I don't know.
Did Jane sleep with Michael again?	Yes!
Yes!	He went back?
He went back.	I don't understand it.
Well here's the thing.	You can't.
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.	Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
Yeah.	Yeah.
Okay.	Hey.
I didn't ruin anything.	All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.	Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
Say it's Saturday night in Spain.	I would think.
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?	You don't flamenco on the first date.
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.	Yeah?
Yes, I think I would.	Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.	Hello.
Hello.	I have to go over to my grandmother's.
What for?	I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
So, what, no lunch?	No, we have time.
Oh.	Ah, she's starting to slip a little.
Ah.	Like toothpaste?
Yahah.	There's a squeeze ketchup.
I've seen squeeze mustard.	Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
Not necessarily.	I really don't see the difference.
Oh, there's a difference.	It's subtle.
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?	Yeah, there she is.
What?	Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.
Wendy?	Yeah.
Really?	Yeah.
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello.	Ah, that's fortunate.
Huh.	No, I told you I admire your hearing.
No, I told you I admire your hearing.	No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
Bye Jerry.	Bye.
People think they're so important.	Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello.
Why?	Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it.
What're you getting?	And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
Huh, yeah, I know.	She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook.
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.	Yeah.
No.	What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
Hello, boys and girls.	Speak of the devil.
Yeah.	What for?
Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.	Why?
So everyone will know everybody's name.	I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!	Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building.
Jerry!	Hello, uncle Leo!
What're you doing here?	Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
Hello Jerry.	Hi Nana.
Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?	Yes.
I'll do it.	What're you doing, I got it.
Give it to me.	Will you stop it.
Jerry, will you give me the bottle?	Uncle Leo!
Believe me.	I'm just not getting any hot water.
Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your shower's not working.	Thanks, Julio.
Awright.	Huh?
Hey, hey hey hey.	What's going on here?
Ohh, nothing, nothing.	Well, then what're you doing?
Oh, I, I need a pen.	What for?
Well, I'm making out my will.	You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
You got that straight.	I told you, forget it.
Oh, come on, Jerry.	You're robbing me.
No reason.	So?
Yeah, she'll be here any second.	Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something.
Listen, Jerry.	Hello.
Well, he's not getting away with this!	Yeah?
Wendy.	Come on up.
Well, this is it.	No no, he'll come in.
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?	It's the obligation, you know?
How 'bout an intercourse hello?	Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
HiHey.	Hi Wendy.
Oh, hi Jerry.	Would you like something to drink?
Sure.	There you go.
Ah.	Oh, look at that.
Oh, look at that.	So, how's everything going?
Oh, okay.	Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
Hey!	C'mon, that's not fair!
I told you I was gonna get it.	No, c'mon Kramer.
Aagh.	Alright, fine.
Hey!	Oh my god!
Hello,  Jerry.	Oh.
What was I telling you?	Yeah.
Jerry.	Oh, sure, yeah.
Thank you.	Oh, no!
Oh, no!	You see?
Hee, hee, hee.	What is so funny?
Nothing, nothing.	Hello.
Hello.	Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
Why?	I don't know.
Hi Jerry.	Hi Joan.
How you doing?	Pretty good.
Just pretty good?	Okay, great.
Are you happy?	Oh, I'm delighted.
Okay.	You too.
Hi Jerry.	Hi, Louise.
Hey.	Ah, well.
For what?	For putting my picture up on that wall!
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation.	Family?
Yeah.	You think I want another family?
I've never heard of anything like this.	I tell you.
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles.	You should have her work on it for you.
Hi Jerry.	Hi Mary.
Hi Mary.	Uh, listen.
Hi Jerry.	Hi Louise.
Thank you for your cooperation.	Hello.
Jerry?	Hi mom.
Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.	Okay, I will.
What's up?	Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
Oh.	Hey, Kramer, look at this.
Hey, Kramer, look at this.	Look at my picture!
Look at my picture!	I've been defaced!
Oh, hey, Jack.	Hi Jack.
Hi Jack.	Hey, Julio.
Oh, I see.	No no, that's not true!
Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards.	You know, she really doesn't belong here.
Well, she seems very happy.	Buddy?
She's right.	So you were with him that day at the track?
Oh yeah.	Leo?
Yeah, that's it.	Is that so?
Well, that's very interesting.	Uncle Leo!
One second.	You're busted!
You're busted!	Hey, Steve.
Hey, Steve.	Hey, Jeff.
Hey, Jeff.	Mary!
Mary!	Don't be like that, Mary.
Oh, that'd be great.	Oh, Paul, could you hold that door.
Hi.	Hey.
What, again?	I got a date.
Ooh, I like that.	Who's that?
Stefanie.	Oh man.
Yeah yeah.	Oh, yeah, I understand.
Whoah, whoah, whoah.	Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
Benes?	Oh, she's uh, she's housesitting for Mr.
Oh.	Yeah.
What're you, the boyfriend?	Can I just go up?
Oh, I get it.	How 'bout those Knicks?
Oh, I see.	Yeah.
Where've you been?	I am not going back down there.
What guy?	The doorman.
Six.	Well, it's almost six now.
I.	We'll still make the movie.
Jerry, it's six.	Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside.
No, don't.	Hello?
A party.	Alright, he just left.
Hey, buddy.	You?
Ah, sure.	So you work all day as a doorman at one building.
You got a problem with that?	Look, I'm not going in your building.
My father opened his shirt.	Yeah, and?
He had breasts.	What d'you mean, breasts?
Big breasts!	So what?
Yeah, that's right.	But, your father's not bald.
No, no no.	Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
A bra is for ladies.	Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
What?	What?
He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.	What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?
Hey, did you make the movie?	No.
You wanna go tonight?	Alright.
Ugh.	Yes, we do.
What is wrong with George?	He's.
Help you?	Hoh!
I traded shifts with the night doorman.	Look, I don't want any trouble.
You wanna be friends?	I'd like to be.
Then watch the door for a minute, would you?	What?
Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer.	Wha.
It's not brain surgery.	Oh.
Oh.	Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.	Hey, hey, wait a second.
Of course I live here.	You think you're better than me?
You have to sign for it.	Oh, right.
Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can't believe you left your post.	He left me there.
Jerry, let's get out of here.	Yeah.
What were you doing watching the door anyway?	He asked me to.
You know, my fingerprints are all over this.	Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen?
Alright, shut up.	Alright, well what if we say.
Alright,  here it is.	I came to pick you up.
Yeah.	I know.
Yeah, I know what you were just.	Alright, well.
Okay, you came to pick me up at.	Right.
You see?	What?
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.	But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
So what?	But I don't know if this is gonna work.
Just stick with the story.	Okay.
Don't you see what's going on here?	You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
There was nothing I could do.	Diabolical.
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?	I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
We have to replace the couch.	Now we have to buy a new couch?
Not necessarily.	The one with the Poppie stain?
It's a beautiful couch.	It's hardly been used.
It's hardly been used.	Poppie!
Oh, hello, Jerry.	What're you doing here?
Visiting my friend.	Ohh.
Oh, much better, much better.	Hmm.
You!	No, Poppie!

"Oh yeah!	"Jimmy?
"Ahum!	"That's the guy?
"Yeah!	"Can't believe your going out with him.
"Why?	"I dunno.
"How so?	"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person.
"No No.	"That's Jimmy.
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?	"Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.

Well I didn't know you were gonna eat them?	Soo.
I'm sorry you find me so repulsive?	No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly.
Yeah!	It's just.
I'll join you.	Oh!
Well I've done that.	Yeah, but with you it's intentional.
Haven't you kissed her?	Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff.
Excuse me just for a second.	AH.
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.	Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
Hehummm , Yeah!	Thanks.
Well Jerry , I guess we should get going .	Ah!
Yeah.	Yeah!
Don't you see what this is?	Yeah!
Yeah!	Oh!
I'm grotesque .	It's just a drawing.
Yeah!	Oh!
I know, I know Jerry.	Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.	Oh!
Hey.	Don't ask.
Well, they're in.	What's in?
The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!	Aah!
Come on JUST TASTE!	I DON'T WANT IT .
HE.	I am not gonna taste your peach.
What?	Yeah!
Flea bites?	Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
You got a dog?	No.
Well, that is strange.	How could I have fleas?
Don't sweat it buddy.	What did you do about them?
Hi Jerry.	Nothing.
Jerry, I'm your mother, now what is it?	Mom, Dad.
Yep!	I don't get this.
I don't explain 'em Mr.	I don't understand this.
I 'm gonna have to seal the place up for 48 hours and fog it.	Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
Well , unless you want to kill them.	Okay.
Why do you have a bug guy?	I have fleas.
Argh.	I don't know.
No, No.	c'mon ,c'mon.
No, No.	c'mon, c'mon.
No, No.	Yes!
Yes!	Yes!
Well what about you.	I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
Hey!	Yeah.
Oh!	That'd be the fleas.
That'd be the fleas.	Hey!
Jerry, are you sure this all right?	Yeah!
Thank god I found you.	Oh!
You still got that Fedex?	Yeah!
No I'll take my chances.	You see?
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now.	I told you to take it.
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read.	Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.	Kramer, they're fumigating.
Toxic gas!	Aw!
My manuscript?	How do you feel?
I'm going in .	Didn't you see the sign on the door?
Okay.	Can you get me a soda?
I couldn't find it anywhere.	I don't know.
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers.	Wait a minute .
Yeah!	Let me see those.
Let me see those.	Newman .
Hello jerry.	There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.
Fleas?	Oh!
So , you have fleas.	You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to.
This food ,it has no taste.	Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
What's the matter?	I forgot my toothbrush.
Oh!	Yours?
No more nuts.	Oh!
It's the real deal.	She's seen you in this thing.
That's right.	And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
He he.	Ahh!
Why?	I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
So where are you staying?	Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
Yeah.	Well, I think he could've asked me.
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care.	Elaine, you always care who an exgirlfriend dates.
Oh, god.	The former still applies.
Oh, yeah.	All right.
No, nothing.	Hi.
I was with David Putty last night.	Yeah, so.
He did the move.	What move?
You know.	Wait a second.
Wait a second.	David Putty used my move?
Yes, yes.	Are you sure?
Jerry!	I can't believe it.
What else did you tell  him.	Oh, it wasn't like that!
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?	Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
Well, waitwait a second.	What?
Isn't that a little.	No!
Yeah, but.	Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same.	Oh, yeah.
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.	I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell me?	Can I just get it opened first?
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves.	All right, all right.
Oh, that's good.	You feel better?
Yeah, much better.	Nancy Klopper?
Yeah.	All right, George.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	It's not even a question of that.
You're gonna tell me.	All right.
I got a headboard.	Is it padded?
No.	Good.
Fivefoot four.	You can't have more than a onefoot differential in your heights.
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.	George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
Is it a clockwise swirl?	I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
Here you go, buddy.	What is it?
Fusilli Jerry!	When did you do this?
In my spare time.	Oh.
Because you're silly.	Well, thank you very much.
Assman.	Assman?
Yeah.	Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.	It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women.
Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.	Yeah.
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.	Hey, David.
Oh, hi, Jerry.	Hey, what's the story?
What move?	What move?
You're move?	The ending is the whole thing.
Oh, that ending was so obvious.	Swirl.
Whatever.	Oh, yeah, I know.
Yeah, that's right.	You can't come up with your own stuff , so you steal other peoples?
Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.	Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know.
All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take that out of town.	Fine.
Boy.	You must have done something wrong.
Supposed to close with the swirl?	Oh my god.
Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.	Yeah?
Elaine.	C'mon up.
C'mon up.	Hello?
What's to think about?	Except that it's not Putty.
What happened to Putty?	Eh, we had a little fight about the move.
Well, of course they're trying to screw you.	Hey, Elaine.
Yeah, yeah, hello.	Is it something I said?
Yes!	Really?
Oh, he's come up with some other move.	What is it?
Oh, it's a lot of just fancyshmancy stuff.	Huh.
I'm not surprised.	Listen.
Why?	You gotta get an estimate on my car from him.
An estimate?	Well, look.
What?	That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
Fusilli Jerry?	Yeah.
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.	Hey, Assman!
Hello.	Hi.
Assman?	Sixteen hundred dollars?
So what are you going to do?	Well, that's it.
Oh!	Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?	Hi, Mr.
Where's your friend Kramer?	I don't know.
Because I'm looking for him.	What do you mean?
In a car, with my wife.	Really, stopping short.
Hey.	Hey.
Aah!	Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!	If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
They say this guy's the best.	He had to use corkscrew pasta.
The name on the boat.	Assman!
Oh!	What time does your flight get in?
Is that the supermodel?	Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
Well, guess what I'm doing.	So that's it?
I've had enough.	You're marchin' in.
Hey.	Hey.
I've done the march in.	How 'bout the march out?
This is it.	Get a march goin'!
Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.	Why?
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr.	What for?
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.	Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
Oh good.	No.
It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, he's got a birthday next week.	I don't care.
By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the pilot is going to be in the audience.	Who?
Remember the plane we took here?	I don't care, why are you telling me this?
I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.	Why would I freak out?
Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for Mr.	Hey, all right.
It didn't go very well, did it?	No, it didn't.
I knew it.	If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine.
Why did we invite him?	Oh, it doesn't matter now.
Don't worry, Jerry.	Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
Mr.	Yes?
I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane.	What?
I'm not surprised.	I didn't care.
Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane.	He can't just throw me off the plane!
Yes he can, if he has cause to believe a passenger will be a disturbance.	But I'm not a disturbance!
Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir.	But someone is waiting for me!
Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.	I'm freakin' out!
There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eightthirty, which one do you want?	Which one do you think I want?
The eight will get you in a little earlier.	Then we'll make it the eight.
I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?	Hotel?
Yeah, it's eight in the morning.	No, no, no.
Midsize, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?	I don't have a preference, okay!
Yo.	George.
Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?	I'm still here.
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?	Carl, I think.
Carl.	Yeah, he was nice.
What company was it?	Defent.
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit.	You need an exterminator?
No, not really.	Oh, don't tell me.
Gotta go.	George, George!
George, George!	Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
Hello?	Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor.
That's at the airport, right?	Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up.
All right, all right.	I am a little freaked out!
Calm down, I'll take care of it.	All right, but you have to go now.
I hope you know what you're doing.	Where are we?
I'm not sure.	Is this even a road?
Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.	What?
You told me not to bother you with minor details.	No, road is a major detail!
Okay, now I know.	Look out!
Goodbye?	Bridget!
Jerry, what happened?	Oh, I'm so sorry.
Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour.	Really?
Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.	What are you telling him for?
What?	He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
Yeah, why?	Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself.
Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?	Yep, Alec Berg.
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.	John Houseman?
Hi, how are you?	Hi, Alec.
Did you hear about Gary Fogel?	Yeah.
You gonna go to the funeral on Friday?	Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game?
Those are them, yeah.	Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
Absolutely, you just call my secretary, she'll arrange everything.	Gee thanks!
It's my pleasure.	Alright, thanks again.
Thank you very much.	Really, thank you.
Really, thank you.	Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read?
Who?	These are the people that want to talk to you.
I will never understand people.	They're the worst.
Something's up, there's something in the air.	Well, what is with you?
Siena?	Yeah, he's dating a crayon.
We discussed toilet paper.	Toilet paper?
Yeah.	Toilet paper's changed.
Yeah.	It's softer.
Sheets.	Comes in a wide variety of colors.
Ok, ok, fine!	What?
I might tell her that I love her.	Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy.
Fiftyfifty.	Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
Once, to a dog.	Well, so it wasn't a total loss.
Hey.	Hey, I forgot to tell you!
Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!	What about you, George?
She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.	Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy?	Sure, fine with me.
El Diablo!	"I'm hungry.
Yup.	Big matzoh ball.
Huge matzoh ball.	Those damn 'I love you' returns.
Well, it's all over.	Oh, you don't know.
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag?	Unless you're married.
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her.	No, people hate that.
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.	Ideally.
Hey, Jerry?	No question about it.
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.	At the zoo?
Well, he started it!	It's a monkey, Kramer!
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.	Well, I still think it's wrong.
Alright, alright, fine.	I'm not taking anyone's side.
Cause I know what happened, Jerry.	No.
Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?	What do I gotta call him for?
Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.	No, I don't believe in it.
Alright, you know what this is gonna do?	Ah, you're out of your mind.
Alright, where you going?	I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
Who died?	Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
So he actually had it?	No, car accident.
That poor priest.	The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
Yeah.	Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?	Gotta support the team.
You know I really hate my clothes.	Hm.
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.	Hm.
Nothing.	Hm.
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.	Hey, Alec!
Hey, Alec!	Did you see that?
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?	Yeah.
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral.	Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Hey, they can't go, "Hey!	Hey.
The monkey.	Well?
Nothing doing.	Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
Oh my god.	What?
She probably never heard it.	Are you gonna say it again?
I'm gonna do it.	What?
What's going on?	He's gonna talk into her other ear.
Oh.	Yeah, I saw him.
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?	Well, not exactly.
He's mad, isn't he?	I don't know if he's mad.
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?	Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!	Look, what do you want me to do?
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!	No.
Jerry, this is the way society functions.	Look, we got five hours before the game.
Yeah.	Hello?
Well?	No.
Oh, come on, Jerry!	Alright!
What can I do for you, Jerry?	Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for tonight.	Oh, you already gave them away?
Yeah, but you know what?	No, we don't care, we just want to go.
Now what am I supposed to do here?	She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her.
Where were you?	I was sitting on the chair.
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.	Of course.
Where you going?	The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
Really?	She might be.
Gennice palying today?	Yeah, maybe.
Who's Gennice?	That's the understudy.
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?	Yeah.
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch.	I'm glad she's an understudy.
Going backstage is the worst.	Just once I would like to tell someone they stink.
The Korean women were talking about me.	How would you know?
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult.	Why don't you go to another nail shop?
Because they're the best Jerry, the best.	What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
Yeah, who speaks Korean?	You know who speaks Korean?
No, who?	George's father.
You gotta' be kidding me.	He used to go there a lot on business.
What did he do?	He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.	Oh, hi Gennice.
Hi Jerry.	This is George, this is Kramer.
Nice to meet you.	Playing today?
No.	They really stick to that understudy rule.
Oh, yeah, she'll be here.	It's okayit's just a hot dog,  everything is going to be okay.
Move it in.	Come on George, just loosen up.
Come on George, just loosen up.	Come on George.
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.	Keep going.
No, please.	It's okay.
Come on Jerry, open up.	Come back another time.
Oh!	I don't know why I have to go to the hospital.
So what?	Hey, I'm being heckled on stage.
I'm having a little trouble with all this.	Stop your crying will ya?
Wait.	Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
Oh, so look who's here.	We just want to talk to her.
No, no.	What?
We'll see you inside.	What happened?
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.	Oh,, that's nice.
Wait, wait.	Where?
Writing for the J.	How did you get that?
I met him.	You met J.
yeah.	What is he like?
He wore a classic courtman's duster.	Yeah, I'll see ya'.
How do you like this?	What is it?
My grandmother died.	Oh, I'm so sorry.
I gotta go.	Good luck.
Shut up!	And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess?
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that.	Yeah, what else?
All right.	Happy, Pappy?
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?	Oh, you're "Pappy".
I'm "Pappy".	Oh, I get it.
Oh, come on.	Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
What is this?	Ahh.
What?	What is this?
What?	OUR LIVES!
No, we're not.	We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
I know.	Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.	Why can't I be normal?
Yes.	It would be nice to care about someone.
Yes.	Hmm.
No.	Oh.
Did I tell you I ran into her last week?	Hmm.
You thought she was good looking, right?	See, there you go again.
I was just curious.	Well, this is it.
Yes.	I'm serious about it.
Think I'M not?	I'm not kidding.
's.	Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity.
What?	I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
Really?	We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids.
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?	Yes.
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something.	There isn't?
Absolutely not.	Well.
They're prisons.	Really?
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.	I can?
Oh, yeah.	What?
You talk about your day.	Boy.
It's sad , Jerry.	I'm glad we had this talk.
Hey.	Hey.
Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?	You're going to rub out the dog?
Uhhuh.	What, you're considering this?
Excellent.	How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
Can I talk to her, please?	Hey!
Hey!	What are you up to?
Nothing.	What's the rope for?
Oh!	The dog.
Don't go.	Did what?
I got engaged.	You're getting married?
Yes!	Oh, my god!
I'm a man.	I'm blown away.
You're blown?	Wow!
You like that?	And she said "Yes"?
It took a couple of hours of convincing.	You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
Yes.	Pinkish hue?
Oh, she's got the hue.	Well.
You what?	Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit.
Uhhuh.	What?
What happened to the pact?	You stuck your hand out, so I shook it.
Well, it's not that.	You thought I was gonna get married?
Well, maybe not married, but.	I mean, you love Susan, right?
Yeah.	No.
Yeah.	I'll pick you up at your apartment.
Yeah.	Hey, wait a second.
Champagne?	Yes, come on!
Okay!	You know what?
All right.	Ready?
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.	Oh, how come?
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.	Well, she could come.
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.	Oh.
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.	Oh, The Muted Heart.
Yeah.	Hey, wait a second.
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.	Yeah.
What about that underwater escape?	Oh, man!
Hello?	Hey, ?
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.	What was that?
Uh, nothing.	Oh, Mattingly just singled .
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.	I didn't make a deal.
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.	We come from the same place.
I don't know.	Very strange.
I know.	So, tell me anyway.
Oh, I can't Jerry.	All right.
News?	Sorry!
What?	All right, Elaine but this is beyond news.
Oh, come on, Jerry.	George Costanza.
Yeah?	Is getting married!
I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature.	Newman.
Hey, good news.	Really?
Well, there's this rabbi in my building.	Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
Yea, yeah, yeah,.	That's great.
I know.	That looks pretty good.
He's in.	Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
What's to discuss?	Come on!
How am I gonna do this?	Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
Well, that's all that counts, I guess.	What's the matter?
Oh, nothin'.	Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
Well, what do you want me to do?	Well, at least have some reaction to it.
Well, I don't.	Maybe you're a little jealous.
Oh, what?	No!
Oh, please!	Oh, yeah.
Yeah, right.	Lainy!
Jerry!	You don't wanna get married?
Yeah, that's right.	Oh, come on!
Oh, you come on.	You're such.
Oh, hey!	Hey.
It can never be erased.	We're gonna change the system.
Come upstairs.	Hey!
I want your honest opinion about something.	Have I ever been less than forthright?
No, you haven't.	Yeah, I probably have.
All right.	Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor .
It's good, right?	I think it's fantastic.
You do?	Yes, I do.
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.	Hmm.
Yeah.	See, now that I don't care for.
Right.	It should resolve of its own volition.
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".	Momentum  same thing.
Same thing.	Yeah, I know.
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December.	You're turning.
Nah, it's not a good turn.	If you need more time, you should have more time.
What, you think I could postpone it?	Sure you can.
That's allowed?	I don't see why not.
So, I could do that?	Sure, go ahead.
All right!	Spring.
Huh?	Beautiful.
She's not gonna like it.	No, she's not.
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her.	Well, she's a woman.
Especially her.	Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
March 21st.	Oh, all the way.
You are a good friend.	Is that so?
Is that so?	Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
Definitely.	You're kidding?
No, no, I would turn you in.	You would turn me in?
Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.	I can't believe your a friend of mine.
What kind of person are you going around killing people?	Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?	But you know me!
He owns a flower store.	So you're nothing but a stoolie.
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.	Another Caf Latte?
Since when are you so trendy?	Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.	I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.	Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night.
I've always wanted to see this.	You know I was supposed to see this five years ago.
Well, yeah, lets do it uh?	Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground.
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground.	Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas.	Let me take a guess.
How did you know that?	I live and breath my friend.
I got to tell you I felt terrible.	tes, it's very difficult.
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do.	Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good makeup sex after.
I didn't have any sex.	You didn't have makeup sex?
Good evening.	Well, Rabbi, well.
I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine.	Yeah, that's right.
I hope she's feeling better.	What do you mean?
She didn't tell you?	No.
Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.	is that so?
Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.	Really?
She came off as pretty desperate.	I didn't know any of this.
Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either.	Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
I've got that magazine article for you.	You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
Yeah, talked earlier.	Yes I know, I know.
He didn't mention .	Yes he did.
He told you about our conversation?	We had quite a little chat.
He told you about .	Yes, about how you're very jealous of George.
He told you all that?	It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
Can he do that?	He did it.
But he's a Rabbi!	That's what's so fascinating.
That's what's so fascinating.	You better finish your little caf latte there.
Why not?	Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
But the whole thing is a mess.	Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people.
You didn't say this to George, did you?	No, .
Yeah!	Yeah, she's something else.
Nope.	What?
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.	You cried?
Hey!	Sorry about that moviething.
Sorry?	Suing?
The coffee was too hot.	It's supposed to be hot.
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.	Why would anyone eat canned fruit?
Well, scintillating as always.	Where you going?
Yeah, it's her uncle's.	Discount?
Elaine and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.	So ah, what did you do last night?
Nothing.	I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
Literally nothing.	Wow.
Hey.	Hey.
Hey.	What are you all dressed up for?
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.	Oh yeah, how's that looking?
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury.	Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
Fine.	Hi Bob.
Hi Bob.	Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh Tuscany huh?	I hear it's ah beautiful there.
Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother.	Huh?
I might be Elaine.	This is a, Bob Cobb.
You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.	Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
That's right.	Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
Why?	Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
Jerry he's a conductor.	Oh conductor.
Well, he's still a conductor.	Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
Monks Cafe.	New shirt?
Yeah.	No, not particularly.
Why, the color?	Yeah.
Too flashy?	Yeah, it's burning my retina.
No.	All right what's it going to be here.
Let me ask you something.	No.
See, didn't bother Susan either.	Are you sensing anything right now?
Let me just say this.	Well, what about criminal activity?
What, he can't jump out of the chair?	Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
Would you get out of here.	I know you will.
Who?	His lawyer.
Yeah, Java World wants to settle.	What?
Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.	Why are they settling?
Cause their afraid of bad publicity.	All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
Jerry!	What do you mean?
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me.	So?
So?	I thought they wanted to settle.
Well what happens if they want to see it?	Then you're in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, he's very interesting.	Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
Really?	So what about the "Maestro" stuff.
Yeah, I called him Maestro.	You didn't mind?
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.	O.
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".	Why not you call him Maestro.
He is a Maestro.	Well, I'm great.
So you say.	What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
Why?	I don't know.
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.	In all of Tuscany?
Yeah.	Hey you know we were just talking about you.
Oh yeah?	Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
You didn't find one, did you?	No.
Nor should you.	So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.	I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
It's BOOKED Jerry!	How'd you get yours?
Got lucky.	Maybe I'll check out France.
Maybe I'll check out France.	Hey George, do you believe this guy?
Who?	Bob Cobb.
Bob Cobb?	You know, the Maestro.
Oh I missed the Maestro?	Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
Huh.	No.
Monk's cafe.	I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
Of course he is.	I have no idea.
It it's huge.	Oh, no way it's that big.
It's a big region.	Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.	Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
So I spoke to the security guard.	Yeah and?
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.	So are you gonna get him a chair?
Yup.	Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out.
Oh I think I'd go for the back.	Swivel?
I suppose he could swivel.	I thinks it's kind of a pompous look.
You mean one of those vinyl things?	Yes.
Vinyl yeah, maybe.	How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany?
You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here.	Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie.
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes.	That's it?
That's it.	You've got to stop it.
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.	You're racing!
Dark room in the back of an Italian restaurant.	Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr.
Si, Si, imma Giggio.	Poppy sent me to see you Mr.
Si, Si Poppy.	Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
Si, the house in Tuscana.	Yeah, right, right.
Si.	I didn't actually want to rent it.
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy.	You didn't have to push me.
I didn't push you.	75,000 lira.
75,000 lira?	Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.
Oh, conversion rate, oh.	You know I don't even know why I brought you.
Nobody put a gun to your head.	Not bad!
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship.	I don't know.
What?	Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
At least I've spoken to my guy.	I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date.
Now you're off on a topic.	You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
Uh hu.	Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house.
What?	Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit?	A healthy person.
I understand.	I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
I'm not worried.	You're going by sound?
I think I can tell.	Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
Twentyfive percent.	Twentyfive percent, you say?
You're way off.	Way off?
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?	UNDATEABLE!
Then how are all these people getting together?	Alcohol.
Yeah, yeah.	Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
Pulp can move, Baby!	Hey, I eat healthy.
I can't believe you've never taken anybody here before.	Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.	Grandma Memma?
Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.	No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
The lamb chops are good.	Anything lighter?
It's a full bird.	You know what?
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.	Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog.
Huh huh.	Did she mention anything about our lunch?
Uh, kind of.	What do you mean, "kind of.
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad.	What are you saying?
You got that right.	But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
Um uh.	What is she making?
I don't know.	Oh, don't worry.
Everybody like mutton?	Um, mutton!
Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also.	Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.
That is so funny.	I wish I could take credit for it.
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?	This is some FINE mutton.
I'm getting out of here.	Uh, well, uh the thing is that .
Where are the napkins?	What?
Grandma Memma's napkins.	I don't know about that.
Down doggy .	Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
Did you do with the dogs?	Yeah, they're in the kitchen.
These dogs were chasing me.	Why were dogs chasing you?
They just don't like me.	I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
We'll have to sleep head to toe.	Head to toe?
Hey, wake up.	I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
You're a wake up guy.	I'll make them later.
I mean, why?	Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
They were?	Yes.
What exactly is mutton?	I don't know and I didn't want to find out.
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.	Reversed positions?
Yeah, you know, head to toe.	So what your genitals are still lined up.
It's Holly.	Yeah.
One more to go.	Hey.
I decided I was going to make you dinner.	I thought we were going out.
Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you.	Franco?
Your butcher, down the street.	I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
A little.	That is so Franco.
So, is the chop the way you like it?	I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
You know something really stinks to high h Holly!	What everyone does here.
Ask Jerry.	We could argue all night over who took the napkins.
You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?	Hey, what happened to my jacket?
Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?	Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.
 How much did you lose by?	I can't believe you write for this J.
uhuh.	I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
Yeah, when the season starts.	How do you pull that off?
Yeah, you do!	Yeah, he looks busy!
No.	What marathon runner?
You know, this guy JeanPaul, JeanPaul.	Oh, wait!
Yeah, that's him.	He's from uh.
Yeah, he's Trinidadian and.	How do you oversleep at the Olympics.
Ah, I know.	I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life!
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated.	Ah.
What responsibility?	You gotta wake him up!
Fine.	I've seen her in your building.
Yeah.	I didn't know she was married.
She's not.	Whom I gonna tell?
George, we just got the final budget numbers.	He overslept and missed the whole race.
I'll tell you what happened.	My money's on the snooze.
Alarm clocks?	What do you do?
I have a uh.	Always works?
Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.	Hot tub?
Oh.	Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
He uh.	I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
Jerry.	Ah, hi JeanPaul.
Nice to meet you.	Sorry about the Olympics.
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended.	Ah.
Yeah, that's funny.	So what happened?
Man, it wasn't the snooze.	AMPM.
Man, it wasn't the AMPM.	Ah.
Yes, the volume.	Ah, separate knob.
Yes, separate knob.	Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
Oh, please, man, please!	Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again.
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again.	Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
Jerry.	It's a simple question.
I've got an alarm, ok?	That old one?
It works.	Elaine.
Hey.	You're 40 minutes late.
I got held up.	No.
What?	Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
Oh are you?	Yes I am.
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon!	Yeah, I know that!
Hey, JeanPaul.	Hey, JeanPaul.
Oh!	What happened?
All right.	Yeah.
Oh that's cute!	Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'!
Jerry, look how tense you are.	I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
Well.	JeanPaul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned.
What are you saying?	I'm saying "get the hell outta there"!
Wakeup call.	These people never fail.
Hey, you bastards.	Hey, how was the meeting?
I really like those sons of bitches.	Sons of bitches?
Heeeeey.	How many sweaters you got on?
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke.	Your core temperature?
Whoa.	Oh whatta hell is goin'on?
Yeah, I turned up the heat.	Turn up the heat in your apartment!
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had.	Hello?
What?	I got the call.
JeanPaul?	JeanPaul!
JeanPaul!	Pretty lucky to find this hotel, JeanPaul.
Man, I just want to get some sleep.	All right.
Man, whatever!	How about adult contemporary?
Fine, adult contemporary.	All right.
Front desk.	Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wakeup call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
Yes sir.	That's room 419.
Yes, I got it sir.	I know, but it's a very important wakeup call.
Every wakeup call I make is important.	Well, I just.
What is it.	I think I offended the wakeup guy.
No, no.	No, no, I did.
Man, he doesn't got "in" for you.	What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
It is his job!	Not comfortable.
It's a marathon, you know.	Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona.
Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!	That wakeup guy was trouble!
That wakeup guy was trouble!	Man that thing is noisy!
Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good!	Yeah, listen, do me a favor.
Yeah, ok.	He's put his faith in you.
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.	Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
847!	Come on, just put your clothes on!
Idiot!	Kramer, what happened to the building?
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!	What happened to your mental alarm?
I guess I hit the snooze.	Make way!
Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver.	All right, go, it's a race!
Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you.	I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby.
Then how did she find out, Jerry?	Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
Oh yeah!	Come on, let's go JeanPaul!
All right.	Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
You called me shmoppy.	You're a shmoopy!
You're a shmoopy!	You're a shmoopy!
All right, shmoopies.	Uh,.
Hi Sheila.	All right, then.
Bye shmoopy.	Bye shmoopy.
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.	No.
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.	He's always raving.
Stunned by soup?	You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
Why?	He yells and you don't get your soup.
What?	Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
All right.	All right.
What?	The main thing is to keep the line moving.
All right.	Right.
Oh, boy, I'm really scared!	Elaine.
All right.	Armoire.
Huh?	He gave you the nice face discount.
Yeah.	What about the soup?
I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.	Pardon.
This line is huge.	It's like this all the time.
Isn't that that Bania guy?	Oh, no.
Hey, Jerry!	Hard to believe.
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry.	Shhhhh!
Why not?	Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
Medium turkey chili.	Medium crab bisque.
I didn't get any bread.	Just forget it.
Oh, no.	Oh, man.
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?	I gave you a taste.
Why can't we share?	I told you not to say anything.
Do you hear yourself?	I'm sorry.
Hi.	Hi shmoopy.
No, you're a shmoopy!	You're a shmoopy!
I'm going.	Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
You know what?	Why?
I just don't feel like it anymore.	Just like that?
Hey.	Hey.
Yeah.	Hey.
Yeah.	Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
Oh.	What are you gonna get?
I'll decide at the last minute.	You better decide, sister.
You better decide, sister.	Uhoh.
How dare you?	Do I know you?
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?	It was a bisque.
Yeah.	Really?
Yeah.	Have you tastes the soup?
Yeah.	See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.	Hey.
Yeah.	Oh, thanks.
Yeah.	So, did these thieves want any money?
No.	They just wanted the armoire?
Yeah.	Yeah?
Hup!	Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
No.	I don't know.
Hello.	Hello.
Were you just talking about me?	Absolutely not.
So, how was the movie?	Aw, we didn't go.
Oh, yeah?	Yeah.
Happy?	I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
Why should I care?	You can't fool me.
All right.	Is that so?
Yeah.	Disgusting?
People who do that should be arrested.	Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
Ye  yeah.	What?
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.	You're still with the pact?
Mmmhmm.	All I did was shake your hand.
Git.	It was stupid of me.
Well, it was very insulting.	No.
Well, behind every joke there's some truth.	What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you?
Well, I guess you're right.	So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?
Yes, shmoopy.	Aw!
Hey, Jerry!	Oh, hi Susan, George.
Yes.	Yeah.
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual.	Well, we're changing the rules.
Aww!	What about you, shmoopy?
Yeah.	Yum yum little tuna fishy?
You?	I'm heading over to Elaine's.
Oh.	Those two?
Yeah.	Are you sure?
Yeah.	Well, let's confront 'em.
No.	There's no cops around.
No!	Let's go.
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life.	I don't know.
So?	Wait a second, Elaine.
What do you care?	Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand.
Get out of my way, Jerry.	Elaine, let the man make his soup!
Oh, yes.	Well.
Hi, Jerry.	Hey, Susan, George.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.	Oh, really?
Mmmhmm.	Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
Oh, no!	Yeah.
Really?	Yeah.
You did?	Oh, yeah.
Jerry!	What is it?
Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!	Wha  wha  what's the matter?
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion.	Well, where are you going?
My code?	So why didn't you tell her the code?
No.	George, you're gonna marry this woman.
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.	So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
Why does everything have to be 'us'?	Actually, that's the definition of selfish.
Have you ever given your code to anyone?	No one's ever asked.
Superman's father on Krypton.	Of course.
No.	What if my life depended on it?
What's the matter with your leg?	My foot fell asleep.
How'd your foot fall asleep?	I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
Hey Jerry.	Hey Fred.
Hey Fred.	My foot fell asleep.
You're lucky, at least you got something to do.	Fred, do you know Elaine?
Alright, bye.	Seeya.
Did you hear that?	So?
So?	And he didn't remember you?
And he didn't remember you?	Where are you going, you just got here?
The bathroom door.	Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.	Uh huh, okay, alright, bye.
Leapin' Larry!	What is that?
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police.	Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.	You're lucky they let you drive a car.
What was that?	Eh.
Alright.	Really?
What are you saying?	Well, what's to be said?
Yeah, but why?	I know.
Ya know?	Yeah, I know.
Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.	Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
Too good.	Why would I wanna do that?
We're out of Bosco!	Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
Ya know I've always liked your comedy, you don't take cheap shots.	No I don't.
Sorry for keeping you here so long.	My foot's asleep again!
That is a great impression!	Larry, wait, you don't understand!
I just came from Leapin' Larry's.	I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?	Yup.
Boy, look at that.	Wow, the whole building burned down.
They just don't know what street to take.	Of course.
It's all up here, Jerry.	The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
Where we gonna eat?	We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
Peterman?	Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
No way.	There you go.
I don't even know Peterman.	Trust me, you're off.
Call the Embassy.	They're closed.
Why?	Bomb threat.
We're in Turkey?	Midnight Express, my friend.
You must be Jerry Seinfeld.	Yes, hi, Mr.
J.	Well, is Elaine here?
What's going on?	Without Elaine?
What, is he crazy?	We gotta get out of here.
I've got nothing, IIII'm blank.	George, what's the matter with you?
Peterman here.	I can't believe you blew us off we were doing you the favor.
Well, Fred asked me out.	Fred?
Yeah, and then he stood me up.	You see what's going on here?
I am?	That's God's plan.
Anyway, so how was the dinner?	Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
What about Georgie?	Nah, he didn't make it.
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?	Why didn't you come up with your own?
I froze.	Ah, c'mon.
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.	Oh, come on, just tell me your code already.
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?	Fire station?
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts.	Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
Oh, so he took you back.	Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.	No I didn't.
Mr.	Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
Water under the bridge.	Oh sure.
Oh sure.	Uh, again?
How did this start?	Beats me.
Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!	Kramer?
You're losing control!	Ah, that's a shame.
And here's your card back.	Oh my god.
Hm?	It's the new J.
Let me ask you a question.	Well, what do you mean?
Yeah.	Hey Elaine.

Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing.	I, I love that George.

Nah.	He might die.
Love .	So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouthtomouth.
Why didnt you give him mouthtomouth?	Ah.
How can you possibly show your face there again?	Oh I can't.
The English Channel Tunnel, Chunnel, runs 32.	I can't figure out what's going on here.
No, no.	What is he doing in the Chunnel?
I thought that was pretty good, huh?	Whad you think Susan?
Oh, well come on.	Yeah.
New jeans?	Yeah.
Still a 31 waist?	Yep.
Lena Small?	Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted.
You're a taking person.	That's why I should date a giving person.
She's gonna ask how you got her number.	Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
What's he look like?	I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
You're buying a speedboat?	See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number.
I don't know about that.	So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
Well.	Yeah.
Very much.	How's the.
I read it in Wall Street Week .	Hello, Lena?
Hey.	Hey.
I had a fight with Susan.	What about?
Oh.	I got a date with that girl, Lena.
Lena, how'd you meet her?	I actually met her a few weeks ago, but.
So, uh.	What?
Well, I just had a fight  I need a group dynamic.	I dunno.
Well, Kramer was right.	So what are you gonna do?
I, uh.	What are you all out of breath from?
The elevator just broke.	And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow.
Hey, I'm in tiptop shape.	I got a 31 waist, mister!
Yeah.	Hey, I have found the bestsmelling detergent.
Mmm!	It's AllTempaCheer.
Can you wrap up all the leftovers on the table, please?	They serve soup at 6 a.
Yeah.	Do the bums ever complain?
I'd get tired of it.	How could you not?
Talk to who?	Is it a lot of cream soups?
What are you looking at me like that for?	Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
What are you talking about?	Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
O.	Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
It's a poker game.	Are you out of your mind?
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'!	You're never gonna make it!
He what?	How'd you find out?
A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.	George!
Pardon?	Nothing.
It's o.	You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!	You went all night?
Jerry, ah?	Kramer, are you out of your mind?
AIDS walk!	So, George, guess what?
Really?	A friend of a friend of Susan's.
My Susan?	Why'd you tell her?
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule!	Well you know what this means, don't you?
tinyurl.	You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
You're cutting me off?	You leave me no choice!
C'mon Jerry, please!	If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.	I don't know, George.
So, Lena was upset, huh?	You know what?
What, it didn't bother her?	No, she said it was fine.
What?	She's too good.
I see what you mean.	I mean, I admire the hell out of her.
Where's the depravity?	No depravity!
Hey, I didn't even use one.	I thought you said it was imminent.
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really spongeworthy.	Spongeworthy?
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.	But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
Alright, let's go.	Hi.
Hi!	Oh, the shutins, that's nice.
Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen  they do have cream soups.	Hey, that's dynamite.
Oh, hang onto that thought  I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running.	Oh, o.
Thanks.	What?
No, you said I was a good person.	Oh.
You seem like you want to tell me something.	Tell you something.
What is it, Jerry?	Oh, uh.
Yeah.	I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans.
I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!	It completely turned her off.
Well, I can see that.	I don't wanna be a 32.
I'd kill to be a 32.	She said I wasn't spongeworthy.
That condom killed me.	It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
You never run out, do you?	Oh, I told him he'd never make it.
Oh, I told him he'd never make it.	Look at you.
You think she's happy?	Who?
The cashier.	Ruthie Cohen?
You know her name?	Sure.
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.	Maybe that's why she's happy.
Good morning, gentlemen.	What is this?
Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.	That stinky old moviehouse?
Well, it's a rare archival print.	Geoffrey who?
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.	I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now.	Oh, then I'm not worried.
Hi Jerry.	Lloyd.
Gum?	That's an interesting package.
I don't chew gum.	Mmm, different.
Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me.	Nah, don't bother.
No, it's no problem.	I don't want it.
Jerry, Jerry.	Alright.
Hey.	I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum.
What kind is that?	It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd.	You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
Right, gotta get going.	Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.	I thought your parents were outta town?
Yes, yes I am.	Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again.	Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.
Sorry you forgot those glasses.	I don't know what I was thinking.
How'd you like that gum?	Errh.
Yeah, put these glasses on.	Well, what's this for?
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.	So what?
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.	Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous.
Hey, Jerry, look who's here.	Ah, Lloyd.
Hi Jerry.	Oh, the gum.
Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?	Uh, alright.
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about.	Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow.
Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown.	's not necessary.
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.	I know that, Kramer.
No, sure sure, he wants to.	Yes I do, Kramer.
She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.	I didn't see anything.
Hey!	So you say she was on a horse?
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.	Well, here's what I propose.
Hey.	Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
What?	I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
Oh God.	Maybe it's in the lost and found.
Yeah, I know.	You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
What, he's not here yet?	Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.	Why?
Here, try this pair.	Aw, these are really strong glasses.
Hey gumbuddy.	Yeah, yeah.
Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today.	Absolutely.
Whoah, Elaine!	Lloyd?
Lloyd?	Lloyd?
I'll run in and get the gum.	Alright.
Got any money?	Here.
Here y'go.	Got all this?
Yeah.	I gave you a hundred dollars?
You sure did.	It's a lotta gum!
Jerry, you have got to come see him.	Maybe he'll write a song about you.
Yeah.	So I take it he's spongeworthy?
Oh, yeah.	Well, he's a musician.
Well, actually, he's  he's not that way at all.	Oh, no?
Yeah.	Come on.
I don't wanna!	Elaine, you're among friends.
Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do.	Oh.
Yeah.	Yes, it is.
No.	Sure.
Exactly.	But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship.
Hey, Jerry!	What stuff?
I just came from the price club.	All right.
Course I will.	A fourpound can of black olives?
Lindsay olives, Jerry.	A fortyeight pack of Eggo waffles?
17.	Look.
Yeah.	This isn't for a person.
How ya doin'?	Hi.
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.	John Germaine?
Oh yeah?	Oh, yeah.
This is gonna be fun.	Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into.
So what did he have to say?	Nothing.
Hot and heavy?	Yeah.
What did you do that for?	What?
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here.	Well, Clyde might not tell him.
How do you know that?	I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
Aw, they didn't forget to put it out!	He stole back the rye?
Yeah.	Why?
Why?	So, do the Ross's know?
I don't know.	Why wouldn't they be?
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.	Bad situation.
I'll tell you what I'd like to do.	What do you mean replace it?
You know, you go out, you get another rye.	Well, there ya go.
What's so hard about that?	All right.
So?	Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
And it's their anniversary Friday night.	Are you kidding?
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.	What about Susan?
She's working late that night.	Beautiful!
Hey.	What the hell are you doing there?
It's BeefAReeno.	No.
Hold on.	Just put it under your shirt.
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye?	I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over.
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya?	So, you think Clyde told him?
He wrote a song about it!	Well, maybe it's a good thing.
No!	No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you.	No.
Ah!	Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
That's right.	There's none left?
That's what I said.	Uh, excuse me.
Well, I'm sorry, but you should have got here earlier.	Yes.
No?	Give me that rye!
Stop it!	I want that rye, lady!
Help!	Shut up, you old bag!
I'll give him ten more minutes.	How much did you give him?
Jerry!	Yeah.
I can't come out.	Really?
Yeah.	Will you get this horse outta here.
Come on!	Wait a second!
Ladies and gentlemen, John Germaine.	How did you lock your keys in the car?
How?	So why don't you get a locksmith?
Hello boys.	Y you're not playin' golf?
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else.	Really, you're getting that good?
How ya doin'?	Hi.
Yeah.	Yeah, we'll see ya.
Assistant to the General Manager!	That's a hell of an organization they're running up there.
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm.	Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
Hey.	Hey.
Better, now.	Yeah, what happened?
You know Sue Ellen Mishke?	Sue Ellen Mishke?
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year.	Sounds familiar.
Shes a pig.	It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect.
Come on!	We're only kidding!
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.	What are you going to get her?
A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.	There's nothing subtle about that.
No, no, she might just think its a gift.	Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
Ahh, HeyHo.	What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days.	So, you're just taking off from work?
Yeah well, they won't know.	Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.	What's goin' on?
Alright, fine.	Alright, alright, I'll do it!
Nothin'.	You wanna go with me up to  the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
Sure!	I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I?
yep.	Oh, man, look at this mess!
I don't know.	Well, we gotta get it washed .
Wait a second.	What are ya gonna do?
I'll just snag the lock with this.	Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
Oh, mama.	Kramer!
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder.	I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
So how did this happen?	He was starin' at some woman!
What woman?	There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing just a bra.
Oh.	What?
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?	Yeah!
Ohhh!	Sue Ellen Mishke?
Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?	No, I don't.
Oh.	Is there, something I can help you with?
No, I really just needed to speak with him.	Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
If you don't mind.	No, no, not at all.
Thanks.	I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
Well, your attitude has certainly changed.	I don't think my attitude has changed.
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.	Well, I don't know if I.
Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?	Nothing's happened.
Oh I see.	Kramer, it is not what you think.
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!	And what about yooou?
You're just out for sex!	You're just out for money!
Hey, it's George.	Where have you been?
Dead?	Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
My cars a little crumpled?	Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium.
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'llIll  I gotta figure something out here.	Well you gotta call your parents.
I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!	Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?	I don't know.
Oh, look at this!	Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Oh, cool!	Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
What d'you think Jerry?	Huh?
What d'you think?	Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
I think your friend needs some help over there.	You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Yeah, oh boy.	You're really going to town with that turkey there.
Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.	It's on the door.
No.	Hey, hey.
No, no, I can't eat that.	Yeah, you're right.
Hey, hey, hey.	What arrangement?
Hey.	Hey.
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.	Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
Ah, I think I really strained it.	Aw, I doubt you strained it.
Ach, maybe.	Did you twist it?
I don't know.	Did you wrench it?
You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?	Awright.
Wow!	What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
What?	I dunno.
You really think he wants the bike?	Oh yeah.
It took him like ten seconds!	Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
Awright, let's just stay calm here!	Seven?
Yes I am.	Awright, let's see.
Alright, you having a good time there?	I got fifty right here in the cupboard.
Awright already!	Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
Christie?	Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck.
And you met her in an antique store!	I'm not engaged.
Ah, I got it.	Got what?
Got the answer, Jerry.	Oh, it's no problem.
Here.	Sort of a mooching inventory.
No, no.	Alright.
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look.	Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
Oh yeah, yeah.	Well this is it.
The same outfit?	The exact same outfit.
How many days was it between encounters.	Three.
Three days.	Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.	Why?
Very curious.	Indeed.
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.	Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
Awright, I'm heading home.	Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
Not yet, but she's weakening.	You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry.	How about 'Mickey'?
Hey buddy.	Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
No, that's yours.	What?
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab.	You cannot buy half a can of soda.
Yeah.	That is the sound of you buying a whole can.
Alright, alright.	Thank you.
Ow!	Haven't seen him.
His chiropractic job was a crock.	Boy, I'm surprised.
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store.	You saw her?
I don't know.	Didn't you get a glimpse?
What d'you care?	Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
Alright, I'm down.	Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before.
Are you okay, Jerry?	No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
I know exactly what you mean.	Oh, I'm sure you do.
Oh my god!	Oh.
Ahh.	Change?
Here we are.	Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
Well, I guess I'll go change.	Yes, change.
Ahem!	What're you doing?
No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.	No, no.
If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to bed.	You know, I'm kinda tired myself.
Jerry.	You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
Get out.	Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow.
Seven!	Hello, Christie?
Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.	Alright, hobo Joe.
Yikes.	I know.
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.	Few do.
I'm good for it.	Yeah, well, until this bill is paid.
Hey!	Oh, I'm back, baby.
Yeah, how was it?	Great.
Good for you.	I killed.
You killed.	Slaughtered.
Unbelievable.	Yeah.
How much?	Nah, nah.
Aw, c'mon.	Nah.
I tell you how much I make.	And I'm always impressed.
Just show me the cheque, c'mon.	Awright, fine.
I wanna see it.	Okay.
Okay.	Here, check that out.
Whuf!	I told you.
My god, you're rich.	Oh yeah.
I didn't know you made that kinda money.	What?
I don't think I can talk to you any more.	I never shoulda told you.
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship.	No, I can't feel anything.
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?	Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
Really?	No.
Well, you should, Jerry.	No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
Now, you see, that's nice.	Maybe a Cadillac.
Cadillac.	Yeah.
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.	Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.	I want this baby fully loaded.
I want this baby fully loaded.	Hey, guess what.
Really?	Yeah, I'm a very good boy.
You gonna sleep on the foldout?	Yeah, yes.
Uh, let me ask you something.	The actress?
Yeah.	Oh yeah.
Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?	Yeah?
She happens to be very good friends with her.	Marisa Tomei?
Uhhmm.	How does she know Marisa Tomei?
I don't know, I didn't ask.	You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
Not the point!	Alright.
Can I finish?	Go ahead.
Alright!	What d'you mean, could've?
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.	Ohh!
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei.	Really?
Yeah.	You know, she won an academy award?
Huhu, like I don't know that?	Now there's a match.
I mean, you've seen her, right?	Katherine Hepburn?
Marisa Tomei!	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, she's beautiful, right?	You like full lips.
Oh, I love full lips.	Mmmmmm.
Yeah, too bad.	This is no good.
This is no good.	Hi.
Hi, uh, excuse me.	No.
If you see him, Could you just tell him the cable company was here?	Sure.
Thanks.	Nice people.
Listen, lemme ask you a question.	Well, what about Susan?
I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?	Would you tell Susan about it?
Not necessarily.	Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
Of course there's something wrong!	Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
Oh, yeah?	Yeah.
Oh.	Well, said he was waiting about two hours.
Oh, was he?	You don't seem too bothered by it.
You remember what they did to me ten years ago?	Boy, I've never seen you like this.
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.	And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.
I had no idea you had this kind of money.	Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay.	Ah, it's just money.
So, when're you getting back from Florida?	Oh, I don't know, play it by ear.
I don't know.	Are you okay?
Sure, sure.	What was that?
I'm aware!	I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
Jerry!	Uhm, hold, hold on a second.
Eightfifty.	Oh, right.
So uh, how are you getting to the airport?	No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
You sure?	Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
Look, I got a few good years left.	Surprise!
What the hell are you doing here?	I'm a good son.
Just like that?	Just like that.
To what do we owe this great honour?	You wanna know?
Heh hah!	C'mon, c'mon.
C'mon, c'mon.	Well, what d'you think?
Look at this!	I bought it for you.
You what?	I bought you a Cadillac.
Are you out of your mind?	What?
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac.	How d'you know?
Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.	Why can't I buy my father a car?
Over my dead body.	Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
Hey Jerry, look at this.	That's what I was thinking.
Hello, Jerry.	Hiya, Jack.
You bought it?	That's right.
I don't feel like taking a ride.	He doesn't wanna take a ride.
Could you believe that guy?	Aahh!
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.	Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale?
It doesn't make a difference.	You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum.
Hello?	Oh, hi Evelyn.
Mrs Choate.	Who's she?
Ow.	Hello?
Hi Jerry.	Elaine?
Well, it's just two hours by plane.	Gee, I dunno what to tell you.
Hi.	Hi.

Bye.	Bye.
Oh, hi Jerry.	Gimme that rye!

Jerry, don't go.	Ah, I think I'll go.
Oh, right, let's go.	Dinner?
It's fourthirty.	Fourthirty?
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.	I don't understand why we have to eat now.
Yeah.	Can't we eat at a decent hour?
You're not buying us dinner.	I'm not forcefeeding myself a steak at fourthirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
Hello, hello.	Jack.
Hello, Jerry.	Hi Doris.
Yes, we will.	Awright, let's eat already.
Help!	Shut up, you old bag!
Alright, I know you're in there.	The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.

Hey.	No, he's doing mine next.
So what are your parents doing here in new York?	Well, they were humiliated.
So what are their plans?	Well, this is the problem.
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?	No, Leo's not there.
Uncle Leo's having regular sex?	Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.	Hello?
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.	You gotta be there at 430.
But it comes on 1130.	Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
How long they been doing this?	30 years.
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?	All right, I'll see you later.
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?	Yeah, it is.
I mean, they're retired.	No economic reason for them to be here.
They have no friends.	No social reason for them to be here.
Where can I buy some ice?	I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
I can do that.	You know Dad just called me.
Yeah, I know.	Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
Ok.	All right, bye.
Ahh.	I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone.
It's about time you called your uncle.	Once a week?
Ah, she's a real tiger.	I don't know how you do it.
What?	A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know.
What are you talking about?	Well.
Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.	Hey, it happens.
I bet that cook is an antiSemite.	He has no idea who you are.
They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.	All right.
Believe me, I thought about it.	Well, keep looking.
Wha, you too?	Yeah!
These showers are horrible.	Me either.
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself.	You?
Aw.	Where are you going?
All they serve is chicken?	There's more food down the hall.
Wrap it up, we'll take it home.	Oh, hi.
Oh, Jerry.	Actually, I'm drunk.
Welcome back.	Yeah, I got some family backstage.
Yeah, I got some family backstage.	Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did.
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did.	Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.	Hey, you're not giving it to me, man.
I just took a bath, Jerry.	No good?
It's disgusting.	Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.	Chicken?
Well, this you're not gonna believe.	Poppy seeds!
Yeah.	Hello Newman.
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right?	Not from the footage I've seen.
Jerry?	What's going on?
My parents are moving to Florida!	Are you kidding?
Can you believe it?	Where are they moving to?
Del Boca Vista!	Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
I know!	We could visit together!
Every five years!	That's incredible!
I know, I know and you know why they're moving there?	Why?
To spite your parents!	To spite my parents?
Yeah!	Your parents are crazy!
I know, they're out of their minds!	My parents are moving back too!
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.	You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this.
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this.	Hello.
Hello, Jerry?	Oh, hi dad.
What was that?	Nothing.
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.	But it's a big complex.
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.	All right, fine.
What?	They're not going back to Florida.
What?	Because your parents are going down there.
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years.	You know what you're doing, don't you?
Move back with Lydia?	C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.	Swinging?
But she's an antiSemite.	Can you blame her?
All right, I got everything here.	What do you recommend?
Oh, and one more thing.	Well, it's been a great visit.
Jerry, I'll tell ya.	Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move.
George must be happy about that.	You have no idea.
Jerry!	Hey.
Sally Weaver!	Right.
Saw it?	Oh, thanks.
No, no, I mean it.	I believe you.
Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis.	Oh, I'm sorry, I can't  I'm going straight to the airport.
Ohh.	Oh?
And Jerry?	Uhhuh.
Could I take that box for you?	Uh.
Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the overhead.	Oh, okay.
What?	I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis.
Well, don't press the panic button.	I don't care about the sauce.
Well, why don't you do your material?	I'm out.
Well, you better get to work.	Thanks for the tip.
Hey, buddies.	Hey.
Oh yeah.	Nobody hit anything off.
I'm salvaging the sauce.	Hey, hey, hey.
Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?	Like what?
Well, uh.	Where's the punchline?
Well, this is certainly a crappy gift.	A door mat?
Pretty chintzy, huh?	Federal Express?
Oh yeah?	Oh, it's unbelievable.
Oh, that's dynamite.	Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?
Who else is on the show?	Uh.
The Three Tenors?	Uh.
The other guy?	Yeah, the other guy.
My God!	Why?
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro.	Why not?
Wow!	Hey, you look awful.
I'm on no sleep, bro.	Problem in the bedroom?
Susan has the doll collection.	Wow.
I don't.	Sally?
Yeah,  Susan said you'd be excited.	Excited?
Susan's college roommate.	It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one.	I will  don't worry.
That's sounds pretty juvenile.	Hey!
You see?	Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
Jerry, come on.	Why don't you just get rid of it?
I tried!	Wait, where are you going?
Did you see that?	I'm just glad it's outta here.
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.	Oh.
It's Sally.	Oh, did you bring the barbque sauce?
A whole case.	Excellent.
No.	How come?
Eh, I like mine.	I've had yours, I'm telling you  this one is ten times better.
I don't want it.	I don't understand this.
It doesn't matter to me.	Come in.
Well, here I am!	Oh, hi.
Hi.	How was your flight?
Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all.	Oh.
That's right.	No, no.
This is much better.	I know it's a joke.
You could just do your material.	I don't have any material!
Me?	No.
Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?	Yeah.
What?	Show the doll  show the picture of George's mother.
Hello?	Hello, Susan?
Hi Jerry, it's Sally!	Oh.
No, but he should be home soon.	Uh, listen, this is important.
Is this for your comedy routine?	Yes.
Is George here?	Not yet.
Oh, thank you so much.	Well, that's one hell of a gig.
Ohh.	Well, it's a delicate mechanism  It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
How am I supposed to carry this thing?	Well, I want to sit down.
So?	It's a trick I just learned from Kramer.
Hey there, Mr.	Where's George?
Don't worry, I brought your doll.	No!
Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about  not funny!	This is a nightmare.
Oh well, I'll be watching.	My pants!
June.	What?
The catering hall screwed up.	Dead man walking.
Hahahah.	Well, one outta twenty thousand.
Yeah.	She did?
Yeah.	So?
In motion.	Beautiful.
Aah, hey.	So, set it up.
The Friars Club?	Yeah, I'm thinking of joining.
Hey everybody.	Catnap?
No, no, no, no.	That must be some book.
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours.	Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.	I didn't know you had a hopper.
Eh, never mind.	Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
Yes, Mr Seinfeld, but uhm, all gentlemen are required to wear jackets in the dining room.	Oh, I'm sorry.
How embarrassing this must be for you.	You just bought your own dinner.
No problem.	'Scuse me.
Friars.	Hey, not bad.
Mmm, mm, mm.	That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Oh, get outta here.	I mean, come on.
Oh.	Oh, come on.
Look.	Alright.
Alright.	This is nice.
Yeah, morning.	Morning?
Yeah, what time is it?	Tenthirty.
Ah, see.	Ohh, I don't believe this.
Yeah, I like that crest.	Breakfast?
Oh yeah.	So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry.	What d'you call it?
P B and J's.	I think you need more sleep.
Ahh.	So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
I am telling you, this woman is strange.	Oh, now you're being ridiculous.
He he, yeah.	No milk?
C'mon buddy.	Kramer!
You awake?	Wha.
W.	Four in the morning?
Yeah.	Well, what's wrong with you?
I'm bored.	No.
You wanna rent a movie?	No!
Well, what am I gonna do?	Ready for lunch?
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy.	You think he's faking?
Did you see that?	That was him?
Yes.	Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay?	Alright, I'll see you later.
Alright.	Hey, Bob.
Hey, Bob.	Bob.
Bob.	Hey, Bobby, over here.
Hey, Bobby, over here.	Bob.
Bob.	Bob!
Hi.	Elaine.
Okay, Jerry, please, please.	No, no, no.
So what?	No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
Get out!	Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
And?	Well, he flinched, sort of.
What d'you mean, sort of?	Well, he kinda moved his head, you know.
So you don't know anything?	Actually, no.
Alright, good job.	Right.
Right.	Come in.
Last night, huh?	That was something.
Ah.	Fantastic.
I told you.	I'm nuts about her.
You think she could be an 'it'?	She could be an 'it'.
We might have an 'it'!	She's got 'it' written all over her.
She's got everything, right?	Well, I dunno.
Well, she's smart.	Whatever.
Hehee.	That doesn't sound right.
No.	Flying Sandos.

Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.	Somehow?
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.	Alright.
Won't be a problem.	Hey.
Hey.	Hey!
Yeah.	Sorry, sorry I'm late.
Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?	Yeah, it wasn't ready on time.
Sure, sure, sure, sure.	Yeah.
How would you kind people like to lend a hand with our next trick?	I don't think so.
Please, take off your jacket.	My jacket?
Give him the jacket.	Alright.
This is very exciting.	Hi.
Jacket?	I had a jacket with a crest on it.
A.	Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
No.	It doesn't even belong to me.
Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.	I'm sure it won't.
Alright, there you go.	No, I'm a little tired.
Really?	Yeah, we'll do it another time.
No!	That nut is always up to something.
Of course, Mr Peterman.	Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em.
Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em.	Wh.
It's a little unusual.	Uhh, I don't think so.
Why not?	Ah, I'm a little turned off.
C'mon, what're you talking about?	Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.
You're soured?	Yeah, I'm soured.
Don't be soured.	I'm sorry.
What're you kidding me?	Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
What're you talking about?	Yeah, we'll see.
Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour.	I'll try and desour.
Oh, that's not good enough!	I'll try!
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.	I still don't know what that means.
God.	Oh god!
She tried to kill me Jerry!	Who?
Connie!	What'd she do?
I don't know!	Why would she try and kill you?
Gah!	Hey, there's uncle Milty.
Yeah, it is.	And there's David Steinberg.
The comedian, or the manager?	The manager.
The manager.	Hey, there's Pat.
Hey, Jerry.	I forgot to take it off.
You forgot to take it off?	I'm sorry.
Where's the jacket?	Well, one of the gypsies took it.
Then what am I talking to you for?	Alright.
Look at that guy.	God, you're right.
Wait a second!	Well, I'm a prospective member.
Until then,  that's the way out.	But that guy has my jacket.
Come on.	Come on.
Get a hold of yourself, Bob!	I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
I told you, he probably went out the back.	Ouf.
Ouf.	Hey.
No, it is not.	No, no, no.
No, it is not.	C'mon I need it.
C'mon I need it.	I wanna join.

Yes .	Hmm.
It looks fabulous on you.	You know.
A Hum!	Really I'll be back.
Yeah!	So I didn't like the crest all that much.
Ah!	Yeah.
That's ridiculous.	Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
But you were!	But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
All right fine.	Problems with the house guest?
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.	Boy.

Some friend of his from England.	Don't you see?
Ideally.	Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
Spite?	That's right.
I don't think you can return an item for spite.	What do you mean?
Well if there was some problem with the garment.	That's ridiculous, I want to return it.

Oh is that so.	Absolutely.
What are you talking about?	Come on.

What the hell is this?	Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
I'll see you guys later.	What kind of pie are you cooking?
Peru?	I did.
Well if these aren't what you wanted then why did you pay him?	Well what could I do?

But she broke up with you.	I know, I know.
It smells like a rubber fire.	What's that?
I said rubber fire.	Oh.
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?	Actually it's being taken care of right now.
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.	He pulled an LBJ on you.
LBJ?	Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.

Wear and tear.	The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
You been rotating the tires?	Try to.
Downtown.	The song Downtown?
Yeah.	You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.	Okay, so how does it go?
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go.	'.
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close.	'.
Wait a second.	Seveneleven?
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city.	No, that's midtown.
'The lights are much brighter there.	'.
'Things'll be great, when you're.	'.
I got nothing, Jerry.	Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you.
You think I should come clean?	How can you lose?

Hi, it's me.	Oh, hi.
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.	Oh, you know what?
Oh no.	Oh, no.
You left them in the car?	I forgot.
Oh, go down and get them.	I can't.
Ah, this is great.	No, no, you can't.
Ugh, okay, alright, fine.	Hey, Tony.
Thanks for coming in, Jerry.	Sure.
I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you.	Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here.

Alright.	Okay.
Hey.	He's bringing it.

What kind of maniac is this guy?	He's a very special maniac.
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.	I don't know.
What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?	You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'.
All the time.	Had I been taking.
Well, did you leave the AC on?	Wwell, what does it matter?
Wwell, what does it matter?	Not that I would think of doing such things.
Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if we find anything.	Well uh, whatever you can do.
Oh yes, I read through it this morning.	I don't get it.
The point is, however it got done, it's done.	No.
Why not?	They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
Hey.	They're looking.
I gotta go.	Y'hello.
Mr Seinfeld?	Yeah.
Are the clubs in it?	Are there golf clubs in the back?
How d'you do.	This is Elaine Benes.

Are the clubs there?	I don't know.
What's the status?	Last checkin, they were still on him.
Well, have they called the police yet?	No, they won't call the police.
What?	They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck.
Kramer has a record.	Not a Federal record.
Kramer?	What's going on?
I need those clubs.	Kramer, I want my car.
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here.	Keep following him Kramer.
Jerry, we got 'im.	How's the gas situation?

Is that good?	It's better than Dondi.
Hey, my God, look at that.	Really?
Mmhmm.	You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.

Hey!	I'm so car sick.
Oh my God!	Huh?
So, now, what is our move?	I don't know, but we don't have much time.
Mm.	The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
Right.	It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building  you gotta take immediate action.
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.	Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford.
Yeah, yeah.	But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
Then why are we calling?	Good question.

It was nice to get your call.	Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you.
Well where ever you are i appreciate it.	So how did this all happen?
Well actually, it had a lot to do with George's comment.	Is that right?

We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.	He's nine years old!
The second I see him.	Hey.
Hey.	Actually, yeah.
So uh.	Yeah.
What was that line again?	No, no, no, it's.
That's it.	Problem?
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.	Hey, board of directors.
Don't you see?	All because of Wrath of Khan?
Yes!	Well, it was the best of those movies.
So who broke it off?	Well, that's the thing.
Oh, come on.	I am.
You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought maybe you had matured.	Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains.
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains.	Hello?
Please hold for Elaine Benes.	Oh, I don't believe this.
Jerry!	Hey!
Hey.	How's it look?
It's a peach.	Huh?
I say, it's a peach.	Elaine, let me ask you something.
No, no, no.	I gotta do some research here.
Hey, hey.	Oh, I'm the doofus?
Yeah.	You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
You doofus!	Okay, question 8.
Aah!	Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.	Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going.
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going.	So.
Yep.	How's your confidence level?
Shot.	Selfesteem?
Gone.	Doofus?
Yo.	All right, so what?
All right, so what?	What is that?
It's the Urban Sombrero.	Well, nobody sees the.
God!	What happened to you?
Whew!	It's the new cover of the J.
Well, I'll see ya.	Vaya con dios.
Man, I gotta go lay down.	No, he's still stuck at the foundation.
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out.	Widower?
Hello?	Hey, Georgie!
My story?	Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof.
I can't go.	What do you mean you can't go?
Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate .	He cleared his throat?
Yes!	So?
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident.	Not getting it.
Jerry, a throatclear is a nonverbal implication of doubt  he thinks I killed Susan!	Oh, help me, Rhonda.
Right now?	I gotta go meet Pam.
Oh, the bookstore girl.	Okay.
Where's Elaine?	She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over.
What's with all these people having babies?	Perpetuation of the species.
Look at him!	So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day.
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?	You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
That's pretty paranoid.	Yes, it is.
I like it!	I thought you might.
Oh, careful!	Hi, sorry I'm late.
That's okay.	You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Yes.	Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.	C'mon, you want to have a baby.
Why?	It's the life force.
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis?	How long did you leave it up there?
Five minutes.	Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
I have to rewind it first.	Is that it?
Stopped dead.	What do you make of it?
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay.	So, what's on your mind?
It's Pam.	Pam?
I love her, Jerry!	You what?
I love her!	Is that right?
Oh, she's uh.	What does that mean?
Oh, and that voice!	What about her name?
Pam?	She's got really nice hair.
Oh, it's incredible.	You've got really specific tastes.
Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.	She's got nice calves.
Oh, she's a dreamboat.	Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
No you can't, Jerry.	But I might.
Oh, no you don't.	Why not?
What.	I think I can!
Huh?	Pam!
Huh?	Pam!
They would never tell me, Elaine.	That Pam!
Gaga?	Yesterday.
Well, maybe we should double.	You just met the guy yesterday.
Yeah, but we have a common goal.	A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
Yeah, of course.	Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French.	I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.	I just came by to tell you  I'm really, really happy about this relationship.
A velvet scrunchie!	Kramer!
Kramer!	Hello, Newman.
Hello, Jerry.	Pam?
Well, tata!	Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!	Alright, Newman!
Easy, Jerry.	Why not?
C'mon.	I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
I know how you feel.	I thought we were talking about me.
Right.	Anyway, I don't need your help.
Oh, don't you?	Alright, Newman.
Well, there is a little something you can do for me.	C'mon, out with it.
It's about.	Elaine?
This is a crude mockup of the conference room.	When did you build this thing?
Alright, whatever!	And?
Okay.	But we already knew that.
Well, yeah.	Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
I don't know if you're ready for it.	Please.
It's Pam.	C'mon up.
What was that?	We were just playin.
Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today.	Uh huh.
How can you have feelings for him?	Why can't I be a soul mate?
What are you guys doing here?	We're getting vasectomies.
I cut it.	It's a little short.
So it's not just me, then.	All right.
Fine.	They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity.
I gotta go zoo.	But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.	At least it's show business.
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.	What if she's got no interest in you?
Wha?	He knows.
You sure?	He knows.
Wow.	Why don't you try your engagement story?
Won't work.	Are you sure?
I put her stats on the back.	Pretty impressive"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95.
Hnn!	So how'd it go with Kevin?
You are not gonna believe this!	Why would anybody want a friend.
Uh.	I mean all that stuff is so small.
You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance.	What?
Jerry?	Gillian.
Very nice to meet you.	It's nice to meet you!
It's nice to meet you!	She had manhands.
Man, Hands?	The hands of a man.
would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?	Would she have hooks?
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?	Kinda cool lookin'.
Uh.	Yeah.
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of .	Right.
Jerry!	Kramer?
Hey buddy!	Iteight o'clock in the morning!
Breakfast.	Why?
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.	How long have I been asleep?
Jerry.	Now that you mention it.
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life.	How much are they payin' you?
Oh, no, no, nonoI don't want any pay.	Really.
T.	All right.
I'll see you tonight, huh?	Wwwha' you got in there?
Getting on the subway .	So the picture worked.
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual.	I don't know, but you don't have it.
Where were you today?	What?
Pick.	Damn.
So?	Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!	So?
Yeah!	So he's Bizarro Jerry!
Bizarro Jerry?	Yeah.
Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"?	No.
Uh.	No.
Is he black.	Look.
Wow.	Tough day at the office?
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.	Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
Would you like some bread, Jerry?	No.
Well, then at least drink your beer.	Oh.
You have a little something on your face.	I can get it.
It's an eyelash.	I don't want to.
Make a wish.	Okay.
Jerry?	Then it does exist.
Yes.	So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
I'm not!	So you're gonna burn that bridge.
Hello?	So, uh.
Uhhuh.	Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, .
Yeah.	Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
That's nice.	Kramer, put the paper down!
What are you starting with me for?	It's your third day.
I gotta go to work.	Well.
What?	Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.
All right, listen.	Hey!
Well, I.	The Bizarro coffeeshop?
Kevin and his friends are nice people!	I read.
Books, Jerry.	Oh.
I'll see you later man.	The whole system is breakin' down!
Friends.	Yeah.
Yeah.	I wish I could, but, we're friends.
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.	Good idea.
Jerry!	Who is this.
Jerry!	If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
Yes!	Got it.
Jerry.	I'm right here.
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know.	Like you care.
You cooked?	I ordered in.
Ow!	What's wrong?
It's my stomach.	You're probably gettin' an ulcer.
You know what?	The coffeeshop?
You got it, buddy.	I'll call George!
I'll call George!	Hey.
Maybe she can get me another picture of manhands.	Elaine!
Jerry.	This is really weird.
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.	I tried to get him one but ManHands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
It's locked.	So this is it, huh?
But iteh.	I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
I wouldn't walk over there.	Why not?
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk.	What about over there?
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.	You were livin' in the village then, right?
Toxic waste green.	That is disgusting.
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.	Well, then you're drivin' me wild.
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.	Oh, why you havin' a party?
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.	Like with dogs.
George?	He's gonna show up anyway.
How could I possibly interfere?	Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
You get the tickets?	Who wants two?
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre.	Yeah I guess I do owe you.
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?	No, I'm okay.
There's no problem, really.	I'm fine.
Food was good.	Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment.	Elaine danced?
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.	Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
What, you mean you know about this?	For some time.
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.	And by then you've lost interest.
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later.	What made him get that thing?
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.	Not a very long trip.
Brody's in.	I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe.	How could that be?
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable.	No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
Ah, it's George.	Oh, what are you talkin' about?
He's like a virus.	Now you're talkin' crazy!
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me.	Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.	Really?
With extreme prejudice.	Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
No, no.	Interesting.
I'm the bad boy.	You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend.
Yes .	The bad fiancMac226, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk.
Okay, the point is made.	The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen.
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen.	Half of show business is here.
Hey Kramer.	That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
Brody, c'mon.	I'm a joke maker.
All right, here we go, Death Blow.	Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
Relax, he does that all the time.	Does what?
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?	May I see you outside for a moment please?
Don't you see?	What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.	It's not legitimate.
It's a business.	Where did you meet this guy?
He's a friend of a friend.	Kramer.
Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!	I don't believe this.
Uh, there it goes again.	Hey, what is going on over there?
Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.	Are you nuts?
Jerry, if the man is in pain.	Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some.
Okay.	All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.
C'mon, let's go.	Oh man.
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?	How was the rest of Death Blow?
He's quite a character, isn't he?	You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape.
Come on up.	What are you, crazy?
Jerry, you did him a favor.	What if I didn't do it right?
It's your first time.	People with guns don't understand.
Hey, Brody!	Hi.
Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.	Yeah.
I've never seen such beautiful work.	What?
You're a genius.	Well, I did the best I could.
Look at you!	I don't want another gig!
But you have a gift.	We're talkin' federal crime here.
The French guy fell off his bike.	No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
That's fine.	Do you even know what this scene is about?
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.	No, bread is his soul.
Wha?	Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.	I don't care about Brody.
So you'll do the movie?	I have to.
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about.	I forgot to make my bed.
Jerry, do I stink?	All right, you're beyond stink.
But I really enjoy dancing.	And that's not helpin' either.
It's that bad?	Have you ever seen yourself?
So where's the tape?	No, I didn't shoot this one.
I need the tape.	You'll get your tape.
Are you out of your mind?	Kramer.
Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!	All right.
Jerry.	I'm off the project.
Well, I'm the good boy again.	They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
Anna actually has respect for me now.	Eh, the whole business has changed.
Listen, man.	Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore.
Jerry, George got arrested.	What?
Yeah.	Oh now I see.
Brody, I'm comin' up.	What're we gonna do?
Well, I ah, gotta give him something.	I think that's it.
Where's the tape?	Uh, well.
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.	Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
Yeah, it's a disturbing image.	Yeah, so you cry.
You wanna piece of me?	But he's an old man, Elaine.
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.	Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.	No you don't.
You shot Death Blow?	Yeah.
That was brilliant.	Thank you.
You were big.	I'm still big.
Yeah, pretty much.	I wouldn't worry about it.
I meet this women, Sheila.	Extra teeth.
Hey check this out.	What mustard stain?
Don't you see.	Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
That's got nothing to do with it.	I see.
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.	They've tried to fix it.
Would you like a refund?	Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
Would you be interested?	Well how are you going.
Would you?	I guess I would.
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.	Not the gown again.
No, no.	They have gotten to know you.
Oh come on.	Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
Seinfeld?	Yeah.
I got a package for you.	Who's it from?
No return address.	What if I don't want it?
Are you refusing delivery?	Maybe I am.
Why would you do that?	I've never done it before.
Why start now?	Why not?
Why did you refuse the package.	I don't know it was weird.
What do you think it's a bomb?	It's not totally impossible.
Oh the ego on you.	Why can't I be bombable?
Who's going to bomb you.	I suppose you think your bombable.
Hey.	There's more than a couple.
Hey.	You don't have a Mercedes.
I know.	The driver seems a little put out.
No.	Is that Burt Reynolds?
Wax Museum.	Oh.
Oh.	That's a lot of skin.
This must be Sheila from the photo place.	You can barely see her face.
All right.	Where are you going?
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.	Oh yeah I like this idea.
Where's Kramer?	He went to get some steak sauce.
Jerry!	Hello Leo.
I got your package.	How did you get my package?
What should I do with it?	I don't know what you should do with it.
Tell him to open it.	I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of "The Mikado".	Open the package Leo.
Okay.	Opening.
So it wasn't a bomb.	No, No bomb.
Well then what?	Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners.
But he's okay?	Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything.
Yeah I am still holding.	Is this my stereo?
Hey you got it.	What happened to my stereo?
That's right.	But you were supposed to get me a refund.
You can't get a refund.	So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
It's just a write off for them.	How is it a write off?
They just write it off.	Write it off what?
Do you?	No.
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.	I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman.	There's no Zorn or Zoutraph.
There on vacation.	Hey what about Dr.
Dr.	He's not that good.
You are a lover boy!	Oh yeah.
Shhhhhh.	I don't like this Kramer.
I am sorry.	Investigation?
Hello Jerry.	Hello Newman.
All right.	Define rarely.
Frequently.	Are we about throw here Newman?
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld.	Actually I am quite comfortable.
Can I have a sip?	No.
Not going to play ball.	You can't prove anything.
Is this or is this not your signature?	No in a matter of fact it isn't.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.	I'm clean and you know it.
Clean?	Where did you get that?
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.	I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
There will be a small fine.	Okay.
Not so fast pretty boy.	Oh my god!
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.	I have some questions of my own.
Listen Sheila it's not what you think.	The timeless art of seduction.
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.	My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day.
Wow.	Mentor?
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.	Hmm.
And I'm her protg.	Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
I still don't understand this.	Yes.
Is there any money involved?	No.
So what's in it for the mentor?	Respect, admiration, prestige.
Pssh.	I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
Laundry?	It's not a valet, it's a protg.
Alright.	Risk management?
Yeah.	Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
I guess it's on my resume.	Hello?
You know what?	So get this book on tape.
Hey, Jer.	Am I going?
What?	Oh, it was a lovely affair.
Alright, send him up here.	You gonna do a little yelling?
I'm gonna do a little firing.	That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
Oh yeah, sure.	Hey, Copernicus?
Eddie.	So, what did you say?
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important.	What?
Copywriter.	He's writing copy?
Yowza yowza.	Jewish singles night?
Well neither am I.	Well why are you going?
I'm not, I'm running it.	What are you talking about?
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.	Lomez is Jewish?
My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.	I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
Hello.	Hello.
Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car.	No kidding?
Kenny Bania.	Bania?
Oh, tell me about it.	Reading for the Blind?
What's she like?	Oh yeah, she's dating Bania.
Bania?	Yeah.
What did you have?	Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall.	Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eightythree people?
What am I gonna do?	Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
You're a very handsome man, by the way.	What the hell is going on here?
What the hell is going on here?	What are you doing?
I got three kitchens going.	No, I don't want to.
Hah?	Oh, this is awful.
Jerry, it's kreplach.	Did you follow the recipe?
The recipe was for four to six people I had to multiply for a hundred and eightythree people.	It tastes like dirt.
Well I also dropped it on the way over.	Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.
So, great dinner last night.	Yeah, it was alright.
I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Bania Saturday and then catch his act.	No.
What?	Have you seen his act?
Cynthia would not date a hack.	Would.
No.	So you saw Bania's act?
He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore.	I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?	He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think it's over.	No more mentor?
Looks that way.	Well at least you and I are okay again.
Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while.	Why?
Well I'm feeling a little disoriented.	I can tell you what to do.
No, it's more than that.	I can tell you what to think.
I need someone I can trust.	Oh.
I got a big problem here, Jerry.	Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.	George?
I gotta run anyway.	I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction.	Yeah, see ya.
Yeah, see ya.	What's your problem.
Hey Jerry.	Oh, hey Bania.
Didja hear what happened?	Oh, that's too bad.
Maybe she's right.	Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk.
Yeah, he's great!	About what?
You know what your problem is?	As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
Who?	A Mister Kenneth Bania.
Bania?	I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protg is a hack.	Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
Mm.	Have you tried the hamentashen?
Hey Jerry!	Bania?
I just stopped by to thank you.	Risk management?
Noooo!	Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs?
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.	Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
What is this, a 'bit'?	No.
'Cos I'm not in the mood.	We're just talking.
Yeah, I know that tone.	They've opened up a whole new market.
Alright, are you done with your little amusement?	Then you admit it was amusing?
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.	Great.
The song.	So when do I meet this jerk?
He's not a jerk, Jer.	Who?
I dunno, some designer.	What song?
Desperado.	Desperado?
Uh huh.	And you're still dating him?
And you're still dating him?	See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
Uh huh.	I invented that.
That, had to be invented?	When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas.
Oh hoh, really?	Elaine.
Excuse me.	Elaine, please, it was a long time ago.
Ohh.	I know Teddy Padillac.
Yeah, that's where he come up with it.	In his dreams.
Alright, can we  go?	By the way, you're doing it too fast.
By the way, you're doing it too fast.	It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
I find it disorienting.	Those belong to people.
Hey.	Oh no, not more checks.
Oh, you didn't hear?	I don't know why.
Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.	They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
Look at all of those!	Naw.
Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?	Why?
He's giving you furniture?	Ah, who are any of her losers?
So?	I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.	Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
Oh, yeah, sure.	I'm gonna ask this guy something.
I'm gonna ask this guy something.	Hey.
Good luck with that.	Hey.
What's with the claw?	Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
Oh, Brett.	Hi.
That's very funny.	Ah, I'm one kind.
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?	The Fleckman.
Farbman.	Right.
You gotta see 'em.	Oh, I'm sure they are.
I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.	No.
Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.	I don't write skits.
Oh.	Oh, where you going?
Coffee shop?	You look like you could use a.
Sorry.	No spiel?
Not a peep.	So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
They could've at least tried!	You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
Please.	Too dumb?
Too dumb?	Well!
Konichiwa.	Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour.	What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?

Is this customary in your legal system?	No.
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett.	What does he listen to?

Yeah, sure.	What?
Hey Jerry!	Oh, hi Brett.

No, it's not that, it's the.	Oh no, look at the checks!
Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the  twelve cents?	No, it's not the money.
Nothing's working for you, is is?	Not at the moment, Brett.
I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.	Thanks for stopping!
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.	Boogeyman.
Boogey?	I'm quite sure.
No.	Eehh.

Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry.	At least it was just the handle!

Dollar EightyNine.	I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
Not me.	Restaurants too?
Absolutely.	Yea especially Ziti, with that big hole.

That's it you leave and never come back!	How about we leave and, come back in a week?

I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.	That's a date?
What's the difference?	How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
If there's any doubt, I do a leavebehind.	That is so old.
That is so old.	"By Mennen.
"By Mennen.	What's going on in there?
What?	That light!
Oh the red.	Can't you shut the shades?
They are shut.	Oh yeah?
Ohh.	Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
We're old college buddies.	I only knew you through Moochie.
Hey Jerry don't worry about it all right.	Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet.
Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet.	How's life on the red planet?
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep.	Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
Ah, they gave me the heave ho.	What are you doing?
That looked like milk to me!	I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that .
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea.	Or I could sleep in the park?
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!	Yea, that's no good.
I may have to drive that place out of business.	How you gonna do that?
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come .	Seth?
Jerry Hi!	I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
That's not going to be good for business.	That's not going to be good for anybody.
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments.	Look Kramer, iiif I'm gonna live over there, yyyou gotta take some of this stuff out.
What, Mr.	And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my.
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my.	Oh no.
Yep, this one for our side!	What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship.
What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship.	Hello, is somebody there?
You should sleep with him.	Hey buddy.
You look a little stressed.	Oh I'm stressed!
So Kramer what am I supposed to do?	You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
I thought he was Kramer's friend.	Well, he called last night about 3 a.
Forty bucks?	No, but the difference is negligible.
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.	Giddee up!
Hmm.	Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
Number 67, right here, right here!	Hello Newman.

That damn delicatessen that  that is last time they screw up one of my orders.	Hey Seth.
Hey Seth.	Oh, gross.
Kenny .	Home at last.
Home at last.	Is someone there?
Is someone there?	Mr.
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.	Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
We got a soccer game in Chile.	Kramer.
So fast?	No.
Kramer's so stringy.	Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content.
Well I would eat you.	That's very nice, I guess.
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me.	Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
Thank you.	Can I have a piece of that?
How long is this not gonna be a problem for me?	Six weeks?
Yeah, six weeks.	Well, so what?
I can do six weeks standin' on my head.	Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
I don't know.	What guys?
Like us.	Yeah.
Mono?	I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.	Isn't bunk bad?
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.	What?
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it.	Hello?
Jerry.	Oh hi, Katie.
Listen, something just came up for Tuesday at the Dayton Civic Center.	I've heard of Ohio, Katie.
Okay, Jerry.	Yes, all right, Katie.
Sorry for the late notice.	Yes, bye.
They asked you to do career day?	Yeah, it's no big deal.
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.	And you were integral.
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here.	I'm on next, right?
Well, unfortunately, Mr.	The guy with the lizard.
So can you come back tomorrow?	I'm getting bumped?
It was fantastic, Jerry.	So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.	I'm finding that out.
Hey, buddy.	Ah, I didn't get on.
You got bumped from career day?	It was a mixup, I'm sure.
They're trying to screw with your head.	Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
It bothers people, and it's against the law.	You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
Thanks so much for coming back, Jerry.	No, let's just do it.
Fire drill.	But I was promised this slot.
Single file, Jerry.	Fire drill, can you believe that?
Pericles is correct.	Like fire in a school is such a big deal.
Hey, you got any matches?	Middle drawer.
Thanks.	Hello?
Jerry.	Oh hi, Katie.
I heard what happened to the junior high.	Oh relax, Katie.
Ashtrays?	No, I don't have any ashtrays.
We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, or Wolfram'.	Is this a repeat?
No, no, no.	Louise!
You think?	Yeah.
Need some more matches.	What is goin' on in there?
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.	Why?
Well somebody had to.	It doesn't?
All right, I'll see ya Bill.	Hey.
Jerry, oh there you are.	I was out.
Oh.	An assembly?
Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight.	I understand.
And, it is already in the school paper.	Superfreak?
Nine minutes.	How am I gonna fill two hours?
Hello?	And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids.
How come he's gettin' so smart?	Are you all right?
I don't know.	Wait a second, I know what's happening.
What?	To a woman, sex is like the garbage man.
I don't understand.	Exactly.
Hey buddy.	Hey.
Hey, you should come over.	What?
What?	It's from all that smoke.
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer.	And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
So the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test.	So what did you do?
I told her I would have to think about it.	But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
I don't know.	You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
Simple joke from a simple man.	So you're never gonna have sex again?
Well, Jerry.	So you ready for the assembly tomorrow?
Oh, sports are so pedestrian.	I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
Your face is my case.	How ya doin'?
Not good.	Well, don't worry about it.
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here.	What for?
I just wanna clear my head.	I think it has something to do with me.
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.	No, no, no.
Hey.	Where have you been?
I got lost on the way over.	Got lost?
What are these?	Oh my God.
No, the Portuguese waitress.	The Portuguese waitress?
No, no.	Then what'd you come down here for?
Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.	It's good to have you back.
One of you has to go on.	All right, I'll do it.
This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.	Cancelled?
those things, deadly dangerous.	Jerry.
Jerry!	Get out!
I'm out!	Is it better than mine?
Oh yeah.	So, it's a twobedroomonebathmakeyourfriendshateya?
You know what?	She's out.
Oh right, the blind date.	Yeah, well, they like to call it a setup now.
Come on.	I can't.
Hey, you got any extra furniture down there?	Oh, this is really annoying.
Well, it's coughing, Jerry.	Where is your key?
Yeah, well, uh, Newman.	You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman.	Mail bags?
That is not the point!	Did you find out who stabbed him?
Yeah,  It turns out it was his exgirlfriend.	Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Well, I don't know.	Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot.
Ehh.	There is now.
Nah, no, no, no.	The botched it?
Hey.	Hey.
Andrea Doria?	Edmund Fitzgerald.
I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.	No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer.
I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.	Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
Oh yeah.	Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
I guess.	Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
Sometimes we don't get what we want.	What are you talking about?
I didn't get my transfer.	"Transfer"?
To Hawaii.	You quit the post office?
Kind of.	Well, get it out of my storage.
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.	Well, a law's a law.
Right, so, I called my friend, you know  the one who set us up  I found out, he's a badbreakerupper.	Mmm.
Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean?	I follow.
Dump him.	What's more important?
I should!	I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!	You're the man!
Jerry!	I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment.
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh?	Hello.
I need that mail, where is it?	What's the difference?
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues.	Well, go ahead.
Blast!	You're giving up that easy?
I usually do.	No, wait a minute, Newman!
An alliance?	An alliance.
Hawaii?	Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan.	"Big head"  That's almost a compliment.
It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.	Hello?
Hey.	Hey, George.
Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.	You can't make it?
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story.	Alright.
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?	Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
Alright, well, I'll see ya.	Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
Yeah, yeah.	Just swallow 'em.
No, my throat's too tender.	Alright, sit down, sit down.
I don't want to!	C'mon.
Jerry!	Sit down!
Hey!	Lean your head back.
Lean your head back.	What kind of pills are these, anyways?
Whe have the same symptoms.	But, he's a dog!
No, no.	Alright.
Where are you going?	I'm taking the car.
I don't know.	C'mon, you wanna go for a ride?
No, Jerry!	Alright, that's it.
No!	Hey, hey!
Kramer bit me!	Bit you?
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone.	Well, what if I deliver it?
You?	Well, why not?
I guess you're right.	What am I gonna wear?
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.	I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!	There you go.
Mail on Sunday?	Oops.
"Do not bend".	What?
That was the Vice President of the post office.	How did they know?
Too many people go their mail!	I tried my best!
Exactly.	You know, this is your coat.
It's not contest.	Boy, he didn't know what he was up against.
They're making their decision today.	What's the matter with you?
Nothing.	What giant freakhead?
The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.	So, it's actually gotten to you?
What?	Either way.
Tough luck, chinless.	So what happened to you yesterday?
I'm sorry, I got really busy.	Five minutes.
Five minutes?	What's the difference?
I could've!	Well, we barely knew the guy.
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.	That's the way it works.
When did you tell George to be here?	I told him to meet us here in ten minutes.
About five.	That's enough.
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.	How did you know about that?
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.	He can't do that.
Fantastic day!	What happened?
Then, I'm at The Foundation.	You're still doing that?
Sometimes, once in a while.	When you feel guilty.
Yeahhah!	What are you gonna do there?
Nothing really, you know.	Yes, I know, I know.
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.	It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
I'm a "honey.	Is he from the future?
Columbus Deli for 40.	Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
Sorry, no.	But it's your bodega.
Oh my God.	You asked her out?
Well.	How could you ask her out?
That was different!	I'll say.
Yeah, no popin, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on.	Conjugal visit?
What's up?	George is dating a convict.
Sounds like a nice girl.	Yeah, sure.
Well, it's chicken feed.	I sense something is afoot.
Cagefree, farmfresh eggs.	Allow me.
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair?	Oh what.
Hey.	Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
Oh, Jerry loves the morning.	Who?
Little Jerry Seinfeld.	Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
Of course it is.	Well, you picked out a rooster.
Jerry?	I'm not having money problems.
He never even called Ed Roydlick.	I'm not calling Ed Roydlick.
That's it.	You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
They're right in front of you!	Ma!
How're the folks?	Good.
So?	I thought you were going out with Celia?
I did.	Having her in jail.
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.	Yeah, dating a convicted felon.
Here.	Huh.
No!	So he just shaves his head for no reason?
And he's growing it in just for me.	It's just hair.
It's not just hair!	It's brown.
It's chestnut with auburn highlights!	So?
Parole!	So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.	Great!
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.	Ah ha.
Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.	Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.
Only in The United States.	It's inhumane!
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.	It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
What?	Yeah!
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators.	No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.
My Little Jerry!	Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.
Oh well, he's more than O.	You let him fight?
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry!	How long do they usually last?
Five seconds.	Great!
Who?	I'm too tired.
O.	O.
It's over, Jerry.	Ah, I'm so sorry.
She's been locked up for two years.	In other words, a normal relationship.
Heh, haa.	Well, she'll still be an excon.
It's not the same.	Hey, if you two are meant to be together.
Jerry!	Then what is my check still doing up?
Now we have a new deal.	New deal?
When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours.	This is Outrageous!
85 cents.	85 cents?
85 cents?	Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Well, that's out of the question.	But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
Yeah, if you got a loser.	No, no more cockfighting.
You know, I think you're jealous.	Of what?
Yah, yah!	Kramer, give me that rooster!
Jerry!	Kramer won't sell.
Well, tell you what I'm gonna do.	Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.
Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor.	You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
Shhh, not so loud.	First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
Can, too!	Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld  big or little  doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime!
Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry.	We'll see about that.
Oh, yeah.	Yeah.
I'm just gonna heat this up.	Hey, Kramer.
Hey, Kramer.	Be careful.
Hey.	Hey, guess what!
Is that good?	I don't know.
Celia broke out of prison.	Oh my God!
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald.	Marriage is a big step, Elaine.
Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.	Hey.
Sorry I'm late.	Where's Celia?
She didn't want to come, sheshe's not really into sports.	hmm.
hmm.	Hey, how's he doin'?
There's Marcelino.	Look at the size of his bird!
Muchos gracias.	He's a ringer!
Lit  tle Jer  ry!	Kra  mer!
Jerry, we can only stay four days.	Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
Only twentyfive minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.	Huh.
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.	Am I finally getting a baby brother?
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?	What?
It's too much car, Jerry.	Aw, c'mon, you love that car.
I don't think we even use it.	Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
We already sold it.	Wh.
Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.	Ugh.
Man, that Emily is wearing me out.	Kramer.
Hiya Kramer.	We're in the middle of a discussion here.
Jack Klompus gave us six grand.	You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
And we want you to have the money.	I don't need the money.
What're you talking about?	Oh, is that what this is all about?
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.	Oh my god.
Just, very interesting.	Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.
Mmm.	That Arabian is strong coffee.
You see what just happened here?	What?
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.	And you misinterpret this how?
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.	I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
No, not nice.	You're crazy.
Stickin' it to me, Jerry.	George.
So you're buying the car back for your parents?	I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
Your parents'll never let you do it.	They lied to me about selling the car.
What kind of money you think your parents have?	Excuse me?
I bet they have more money than mine.	Come on, your parents have money.
You think?	When did they ever spend any money?
Never.	What are their living expenses?
Nothing.	Where do they ever go on vacation?
How much money d'you think they have?	Few hundred grand?
You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?	Course you may not see it for twenty years.
Twenty years?	Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
Fortunately, yes.	How's your family history?
I have an aunt that died at seven.	Really?
Get out!	So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City.
You just heard about this today?	They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
Who cancelled?	Carrot Top.
So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?	I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
I'm kidding.	Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
Nine thousand for a Cadillac?	You bought it for six!
You're not me.	How much d'you want for it?
The Kelly blue book value.	Fourteen thousand.
Hey look, he's back.	I got your message,  so I came straight from Atlantic City.
Jerry, Kramer called Bally's.	Well, I can't stay under my own name.
Well, I'll see you.	Hello.
I'm down here in alligator alley.	Huh.
Who was that?	That was the Golden Nugget.
What took you so long?	I live in New York.
This thing is a, is a behemoth.	What did you do?
I was, I was making a, a simple lane change.	You are such an idiot.
Do whatever you want.	My car?
It drove itself into the swamp!	You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
Jerry, it's getting late.	Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room.
You are uh, thinking of staying here?	Well.
You've got some nerve.	You didn't like that crack about the pen.
I think you're sticking it to me.	Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
Stickin' it!	You're not alone.
Really?	No.
Hmmhmmhmmhmm.	Well, you seem happy.
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?	Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.
The ocean called.	'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Really?
Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.	Oh.
No.	I'm gonna grab a can of balls.
Hello.	I need a can of balls.
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?	No.
Can you do that for me, buddy?	Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
Well, I'm gonna type it up.	Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?	Yeah.
Yeah.	In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
Well, you're not gonna need this any more.	Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
The same.	He called you?
He musta got my number off the computer.	To a guy you've never met?
Oh god, that guy's terrible.	Mmmhmm.
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?	George used up all my guest passes already.
Ahh.	Come on.
Thank you.	Here you go.
Here you go.	Milos?
The executor?	Kramer wants to die with dignity.
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.	D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
Who's Reilly?	George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called.
What does that mean?	Hey, here you go.
Did you take this out of the garbage?	Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
You see?	Trust me, Kramer.
That's right.	Hello Milos.
I.	You can't even play.
Believe me, it is Milos great shame.	You could do that?
Jerry, for you, anything.	Game, set and match, huh Milos?
Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry.	You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money.
Shhhshhh.	Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
Yeah, you'll make it up to me.	Tennis, anyone?
Hello.	Hello.
I think so.	Hoh, that Milos.
Why don't we just go up to your apartment?	Alright.
Alright.	Gotta be an easier way.
I feel so rested and refreshed.	So, you play tennis?
Enough talk, Jerry.	Not for me, I love chatting.
No!	Who?
Milos.	Your husband?
So, details?	Well, I didn't sleep with her.
Because of society, right?	Yes, George, because of society.
Reilly is no longer with the club.	Ah, you're better off.
Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.	You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.	I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger problems to fry.	I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do.	Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around.
Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around.	So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
Look what came in the mail today.	Wh.
It's the play button, off his VCR.	Boy, look how far back it goes.
Yep.	You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
Oh.	Too good.
Another game for Milos!	You're on fire today.
He's not a man, this Jerry.	Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
Look at the big baby!	I told you to cut it out.
Hi.	He's been sleeping a lot.
Oh.	What happened to Vincent?
So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, and all your risk factors.	So what's the great moment?
I can't believe this is our first date.	I know.
I suppose I have to get a piece of cake.	Why?
Today's my birthday.	What?
So, she went out with you on a first date.	Yeah.
Is she socially awkward?	No, she's great!
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.	She's not Lincoln.
Hey!	I'll pass.
Noo!	to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing.	Wow.
Hey.	Hey.
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's  loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.	The Van Buren Boys?
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.	Well, what does that mean?
Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this.	She coming of a bad breakup?
See ya!	Any messages?
So, she's the loser of the group.	There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?	No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.	Yeah?
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.	Is he smart?
He knows how to read.	Hey!
Yes.	I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
No, this is brand new.	Actually, yeah.
No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one.	I guess that's all right.
Is something wrong, Jerry?	No, absolutely nothing.
Hey.	Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
I was betrayed!	You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field.
You're spending the weekend with Ellen?	Vermont!
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.	What?
Jerry, she's a loser.	Where is this coming from?
Why're you doing this, Jerry?	There's nothing wrong with my career!
Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.	Alright!
Which one?	They were all like that!
These Kramer stories are unusable!	Is my toaster oven on there?
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?	Well, just shape them  change them.
Yes!	Make them interesting.
Interesting!	Well, I gotta go to the airport.
What?	Yeah.
Maybe we could all have dinner later?	I don't think so.
Oh, hey!	Kramer, this is awful!
Damn!	What?
Oh, Jerry, you're parking meter's about to expire.	So?
Jerry, she's fantastic.	I knew it!
And so much personality!	Now, I'm not so sure.
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.	yeah, Amber.
Look how dark it's gettin' already.	Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.
When does it start?	I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
Uh.	Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems.
Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems.	Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit.
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony.	I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
Kramer!	Fine.
Guess what?	No openings in arson?
Ah no no no.	I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself.
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie.	I don't see you as a Susie.

I'm sorry.	Something wrong with this trunk.
Mike's outside.	Well why doesn't he just come in?
Because he's scared, Jerry.	Why is he scared.
Uhahah!	It was an accident.
I'll get you the money, Jerry.	I don't want it that way.
Nuh!	Fine.
See that was nice, Jerry.	Ah, it's just a car.
What do you think, Jerry.	I don't know, I just see you guys together.
Oh!	So Peterman bought it?
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.	Yeah, I know how you feel.
Do you hear something?	What?
What?	Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.	Well, there's only one thing to do.
What?	Get Rid of Susie.
I kinda like her.	She's Gooone.
Look at this turnout.	Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people.
I guess I never met Susie.	Suze?
Ahhh.	Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em.
Hold on!	Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
Morning.	Morning.
Hope you don't mind baking soda flavour.	Ah, baking soda.
So?	So?
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?	Yeah.
You didn't tell her.	Jenna's like me.
Finicky?	I'll take fastidious.
I'll take fastidious.	What is that?
Holy cow!	They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
Hey.	Why didn't you pull over?
Well, I'm a poppa.	Bring it on.
Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a onemile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.	Oh, that adoptahighway thing.
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry.	Aw, looks just like you.
Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.	So what d'you have to do?
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their socalled maintenance equipment.	That old scam.
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself.	At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
Keys.	You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?
Have you seen 'em?	No.
Right.	Well, they're not here.
I don't have a spare set.	So?
This isn't fair.	Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?	By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it.
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.	You didn't look down?
Holy, Holy Cow!	Poor son of a bitch.
Poor son of a bitch.	It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second.
It's like I'm holding a blender.	The engine's made by McDonnellDouglas.
The engine's made by McDonnellDouglas.	Oh no, you keep going.
Really, it does?	When the battery runs out.
I was really happy with my old toothbrush.	No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good.
That stuff tastes like bleach!	I don't know anything about that.
Mmm.	That's the idea.
That's the idea.	You know, maybe we better not.
You still couldn't kiss her?	She has a taint.
Jer, do you see where this is going?	Being really clean and happy?
Jerry, you have tendencies.	Disorder?
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from fullon dementia.	Hmm, that could hurt me.
Shall we stop and say hi?	Nah, we've seen it.
Well, the lock was broken.	What's with the signs?
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry.	Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.
Speed limit, one hundred and sixtyfive miles per hour.	Hey.
No keys.	I guess they leave that up to the general population.
I tell you this.	Hard to say.
Oh yeah, yeah.	Yeah?
It's Jenna.	If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
Hey.	Hi.
How you feeling?	Good.
What?	Nothing.
What?	I'm sorry.
When were you gonna tell me this?	Obviously never.
I need the yield sign.	Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something.
You could've introduced me.	I wouldn't know where to start.
I wouldn't know where to start.	Hey, Jenna.
There.	What?
Gotta run.	Oh, man!
Oh, man!	Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula?
She won't even give you a hint?	No.
You know what I bet it is?	Yes, that is a definite possibility.
Or, could be your walkman there.	Are you just screwing with me?
Hey ah.	Hey, how's life on the road?
Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.	I don't doubt it.
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces.	What's this?
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lanelines?	Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.	What the hell are you talking about?
Well you black out lanelines one and three, and a fourlane highway becomes a twolane comfort cruise.	Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number fortyseven.	OneQ?
That's the janitor closet, across the street.	You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
Oh it's you.	Is the flounder here yet?
There's this.	Nice.
Hey.	Hey.
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.	Kramer's guys?
Yeah.	Oh that's nice, kind of a hardlabour fantasy camp.
So Jerry, why'd you call me?	Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness.
Yes, I did.	Well, whatever.
Good.	Good.
Just eating away at you isn't it?	Nah.
Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	For what?
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.	Dirt?
Well, actually it's pretty grimy.	Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze.
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.	Sure.
Bye.	There, you see?
Toilet brush.	Toilet brush, oh .
You wanna order dinner?	Yeah.
Yeah.	That's true.
Mm.	But, I'll tell you this much.
Do you hear something?	I don't know what that could be.
Holy cow!	Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future.
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future.	Holy cow!
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.	You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?	He's wailing on that banjo.
Yeah.	I just don't understand the raisinettes.
The sax player?	Yeah.
Yeah.	The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
So?	Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes?
HE's not gonna eat them.	Why's he dating a Pepsi?
He's a musician.	Musicians.
Saved a fortune.	Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.
Yeah.	Ooh, and it's in medium.
Hey.	Hey.
Hey.	Almost.
Aw, c'mon man.	Alright.
Yeahh.	We're even.
Jerry, figure this out.	That's a nice four seconds.
I look just like him.	Maybe he has money.
Maybe he doesn't.	Sometimes you do.
Maybe it's some small thing I could change.	Who's she dating?
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room.	Stairmaster?
What?	Nothin'.
See what I'm wearing?	Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
No, your mother found it.	You know, I bought you a Cadillac.
See that?	I could, but I choose not to.
This is my son Jerry, from New York.	I.
Your kid's pretty funny, Morty.	Actually, I am a comedian.
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.	Eighteenfifties?
Yeah, that's it.	Mr Mandelbaum, I.
C'mon, c'mon.	Alright.
Yeah, wrong attitude.	There.
How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum?	He egged me on.
You should be more mature.	He's eighty!
Goodnight.	Alright.
Jerry Seinfeld please.	Ah, you must be Kramer's guys.
What cigars?	Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.	They're real Cubans?
I said Cubans.	Cigars!
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country.	You're making your own cigars now?
Yeah, yeah.	Hold on a second.
Who are they?	They're Cuban cigar rollers.
Don't tell your mother.	What is that bubbling sound?
Hot and spicy.	You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
Yes I am.	What colour is it?
Hey.	This is quite a condo.
The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.	The crepe place?
Yeah.	There's crepe money?
What are you doing here?	Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
What the hell is that?	What?
Oh, I see how it works now.	Mr Mandelbaum, please.
Call an ambulance.	I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.	So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?
Some guy.	George, you've got Danielle.
So, I'm Neil?	I don't know, but you better keep it up.
I'm gonna go meet Danielle.	I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles.
Hey Jerry.	I will, I just walked in the door.
You have to go see him.	Ma.
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station.	What?
They're not real Cubans.	So?
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.	What's the difference?
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.	We're talking about people, right?
Yes, yes.	I thought they smelled pretty nice.
Jerry, your palate's unrefined.	Is not.
Is too.	Is not.
Is too.	I'm not having this conversation.
Are too.	Am not.
Are too.	Am not.
That's it!	Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best.
How 'bout that, huh?	That's very nice.
The best in the world.	Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
Hi daddy.	This is your son?
Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man?	You got any kids?
Oh, you think you're better than me?	Look, noone is lifting anything.
The television.	Oh no.
Call an ambulance.	We're already in a hospital.
Yuh.	You asked her to move in with you?
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.	What if it's Neil Armstrong?
Then I'm going to Mars!	What if it's Neil Diamond?
Aw, shut up Jerry!	Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
What, to see the old guy?	No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
How old's the son?	I think he's the same age as the father.
What is with this family?	I dunno.
Datiditadit.	You're cold?
No.	Something wrong with your chest?
Dijadidatjd.	Where?
Over there.	Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it.	Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
Yeah.	I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
I bet you pulled that trick on my daddy, in Florida.	He couldn't handle the weight.
You think you're better than him?	Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
My grandpa.	Oh, come on!
What happened to him?	He was trying to lift the TV.
That TV?	Oh no.
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum.	Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
Oh yeah, that's right.	I didn't ruin your business.
Yes, you did.	Don't you hire people to do that?
Each crepe has to be handrolled by a Mandelbaum.	So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
Yeah.	I think I can help you out.
Hey, I can't see the TV.	Here.
Great.	He was gonna fire you?
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.	Tunisia?
That's where they filmed the movie.	Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
I have to live in a cave.	Oh.
Neil!	Why are the crepes spraying?
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.	That's good stuff.
I can't to myself.	Can you grab a nap at work.
Bye.	So what are you doing now?
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.	With a gentleman caller?
Yes, his name is Hal.	The walking date is a good date.
It's the next best thing to being alone.	Shower?
Oh, yeah, that's right.	A little slow.
Oh, Jerry are you okay with this hinge?	Yeah.
I can get you any kind you want, you know.	You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
Oh, these are different.	Drop one.
Jerry, look at my eyes.	A little less beady today.
Because I'm REFRESHED.	Sounds like a really cool fort.
Jerry, do you want a flat edge on this molding or do you want me to bevel it?	I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
Uh, let me ask you a question.	He's kind of tied up here.
There is no normal, whatever jerry wants.	Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
Whatever you want.	So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
Uh, it was okay,.	I don't know.
got problems Jerry.	What happened?
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going.	How long did that last?
A half hour then diving class started.	How was the movie?
I cancelled.	Why?
He's got a back problem.	So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
Oh, that's right.	So what are you going to do with the mattress?
Hi, Jerry I'm sorry I'm late.	How about this?
Couple of questions for you.	No.
All right Jerry.	Just .
Jer.	Hi.
Well my swimming pool problems are solved.	What is that smell?
That's East River.	You're swimming in the East River?
Technically Norfok has more gross tonnage.	How could you swim in that water?
I saw a couple of other guys out there.	Swimming?
Oh, well, send them in.	hello.
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk.	Who is this?
Can't you think of something.	A bomb threat?
Just CALL!	I should have some reason.
Jerry, Jerry.	Yeah.
What the hell is this?	Over here.
What is this.	It's kind of cozy.
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress.	Does it smell like the East River?
How did you know?	Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
It is very obtrusive.	I don't think it's that bad.
You can't get a stool in here.	No the stools go over there.
Fitted Hat Day!	You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats?
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day?	Hey look at you.
Yeah, look at me.	No knock offs.
SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!	Why are you shouting?
Hello are you the bomber?	Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.	think I've changed my mind.
Well what do you want instead?	What?
You want it back the way it was?	Yeah, that's right.
You know I don't get you Seinfeld.	One second.
Jerry you gotta help me.	Just lie down.
I am lying down.	All right.
Yeah, well, whatever.	Ah, back to normal.
Oh, George.	I saw it.
How'd he look?	Okay.
Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad.	I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada.
Is "yada yada" bad?	No, "yada yada" is good.
She is succinct.	Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today.
Hey.	Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.
Yeah, dentist of the stars.	What's up?
I'll tell you what's up.	Excuse me?
I'm a Jew.	Well.
Oh, well, I didn't do much.	Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
So what?	Booze is not a religion.
Tell that to my father.	Ooh.
What are you talking about?	I gotta get on that internet.
Oh, you're in here.	What're you doing here?
I knew you had an appointment.	Well this is very awkward.
I'll leave when the guy comes in.	Hey, you don't play with that.
Hey, what this thing?	All right, that's enough.
Hey, Tim.	George.
All right, it is cavity time.	Hey.
Those aren't mahtzah balls.	Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
Why not?	I know, but.
Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.	5000.
5000, even better.	And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
Why are you so concerned about this?	I'll tell you why.
Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times?	Yes.
That's it, it's go time!	All right, take it easy.
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.	How you doing?
Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in?	Whatley.
All right, which one is Julie?	So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic.
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke.	Don't you see what Whatley is after?
Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine.	They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
Thought it would be nice.	Poor Beth.
Hey, Arnie's just as upset.	Oh screw him!
Yeah.	But you yada yada'd over the best part.
Well, I gotta do somethin'.	George is already in there.
No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out.	I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
Well, what about you?	Excuse me, Mother?
Sister.	Sister, right.
Well not until tomorrow.	Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
That's a kneeler.	Oh.
Tell me your sins, my son.	Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
That's no sin.	Oh good.
And this offends you as a Jewish person.	No, it offends me as a comedian.
Well.	And they're old jokes.
I haven't heard that one.	Oh, I'm sure you have.
One second.	You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
Um.	Newer magazines.
See, again with the yelling.	Oh, are you about done?
I'm just getting warmed up.	Huh?
Father Curtis told me about your little joke.	What about all your Jewish jokes?
I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist.	The Jews?
No, the dentists.	Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
So, I'll uh.	Date with Karen?
No, Julie.	What happened to Karen?
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common.	Oh, small world.
Oh yeah, and vice versa.	So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today.
Those people, listen to yourself.	What?
You think that dentists are so different from me and you?	Kramer, he's just a dentist.
Yeah, and you're an antidentite.	I am not an antidentite!
You're a rabid antidentite!	They do have their own schools!
Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me.	Well, what's wrong?
I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.	Talk to me.
He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me.	Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
But we just got married.	Well obviously that was a mistake.
Why would Elaine do that to me?	Forget about Elaine.
Hey Jerry.	I'm kinda in the middle of something.
Karen and I are getting married.	Oh, congratulations.
Hey Jerry.	Beth and Arnie broke up.
So they don't want a baby?	Pff.
I think I'm gonna be sick.	Hey, where's Marcy?
I just assume not sit next to you.	Kramer.
Nice looking family.	Very handsome.
Oh Mickey.	Hi, Mr.
What was that all about?	Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?	What?
A dentist.	That's a good one.
Where's Beth?	She went out to get her head shaved.
We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy.	Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
Ready to go?	Me neither.
I think that I was in that theatre.	Yeah, it got a good laugh.
So you're on the speed dial?	After two dates!
What number?	Seven.
Uh, hey buddy.	Hey.
It all right if I keep these here for a while?	You're gonna keep these here for eight months?
No, Jerry.	Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?
Hey, so get this.	What for?
I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry.	Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.	I don't mind the Mayans.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh?	Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
We didn't say that.	Hi.
Someplace nice this time?	Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night.
I don't know, got a two in Zagat's.	Lemme just check my messages.
Hello?	Hello?
Jane.	Seven?
There was no meeting.	You can do that.
Of course.	So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
You think people will still be using napkins in the year twothousand?	So, George.
Yeah.	I had like a soso date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speeddial.
So?	So?
What, she's ranking you?	Yeah, this speeddial's like a relationship barometer.
Oh, flowers.	Well, I just wanted to.
I'm gonna go put these in some water.	I like the way you think.
I like the way you think.	Oh my God!
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together.	Some of us.
I don't wanna exclude anybody.	Hola.
Shove it!	What is all this?
Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun.	Hi Valerie.
Hi Valerie.	You're not Valerie.
Hey, how 'bout some lunch.	You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speeddial.
You deserve it.	But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more.
My stepmother got to you, didn't she?	What?
Uuh, I can't believe she did this again.	Yikes!
That he may be.	How could they not fire you?
Never thought I'd fail at failing.	Aw, come on there now.
Feel like I can't do anything wrong.	Nonsense.
Everything?	Everything.
You really think so?	Absolutely.
Alright.	That's the spirit.
I'm sure she'll be along.	Okay.
You know Jerome, I can understand what Valerie sees in you.	Uh, good.
Jerome, I have a deliciously naughty idea.	What?
Why don't I put you on my speeddial?	I don't know, Mrs Hamilton.
Don't be such a child, Jerome.	Valerie's not coming over, is she?
Seven, four.	No.
Two.	Stop, stop.
I won't tell if you don't.	Wuhh.
Alright, Yankees, two.	Oh my God, George!
Check that.	Kramer, look, it's George.
Yeah, yeah, I know.	Fine.
I mean, it's killing me!	No problem.
Can do.	What're you doing with a pricinggun?
That place is about to have the sale of the century.	Still a ripoff.
Still a ripoff.	Hello?
Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her speeddial.	Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.	Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.	Hello?
Hi Jerome.	Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time.
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time.	Hello?
That's her on the other line, isn't it?	Well.
Tell her I don't want you on her speeddial.	Hang on.
Hang on.	She knows about the speeddial.
I won't, until she puts me back on hers.	Hang on.
Hang on.	She wants to be back on yours.
Fine.	Hang on.
Hang on.	Fine, if I'm off yours.
No, still me.	Sorry.
Sorry.	Fine, if I'm off yours.
I won't do it.	Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
Alright.	Great, bye.
Great, bye.	She said she'll do it.
Great.	Hang on.
Hang on.	Hello?
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about.	She never sees the big picture.
She never sees the big picture.	Hello, Newman!
You don't wanna do your.	No.
To the Kramennium.	By the way Newman, I'm just curious.
I'll call for help.	Hello?
Who's this?	It's Jerry.
Uh, it's Valerie.	Oh, hi Valerie.
I'll tell you what's up.	Wow, poison control?
Wow, poison control?	Hello?
Hello?	Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
Yeah.	Let's go.
Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.	For how long?
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.	Come on.
Where are you going?	I'm going to be this guy's friend.
I'm going to be this guy's friend.	New clothes?
Yeah.	Strange.
The guy never came back.	He asked you to watch them not wear them.
I'm still watching them.	You look like a tourist.
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?	When you hear like a soft russeling.
It's like puberty that never stops.	Oh right, the new job, how is it?
I love it.	So who's the new you?
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High.	Oh hi Alex.
I'm sorry I'm late.	No.
Where are you meeting these women?	Right here, George.
He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.	Get out!
Ooh.	Hmm.
So get this.	Yeah that's too bad.
What's the matter with you?	Nothing.
No, no, no.	I did something stupid.
What did you do?	Well I was shaving.
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.	Well women do it.
"Well women do it.	Well what am I going to tell Alex?
Listen to me.	Um hum.
Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.	Hey!
How about the beach this weekend?	You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend.
All right.	Really?
Mr Lippman?	So you're pretending to be a tourist?
It's beautiful.	How do you explain your apartment?
I got a hotel room.	you moved into a hotel?
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry.	So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
So?	So.
Oh really.	Are you nuts?
Reality tour?	The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
George, no offense.	You're moving to New York?
Eat me alive, huh?	What is it she think you can't do?
Find a job.	How did you do those things?
Never mind.	Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
Here you go, here you go, check it out.	"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour".
Peterman's book is big business.	Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
Understand?	Yeah.
Hey Jerry.	What?
What are you doing to yourself?	I can't stop.
You can't keep this up.	Oh that's an old wives tale.
Look at it!	Oh come on.
Ahh.	Why do I have to go on the tour?
Jerry you're a minor celebrity.	Hey, how's business?
You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't use cinnimon rasin.	You also shouldn't use a donut.
Turn music off.	Can we just go?
You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you?	What's that?
Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.	Oh.
These clothes.	Kramer how much longer?
Don't worry.	I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.	I can't sit on this bus anymore.
Jerry what's the matter?	Awoooooooooooooo, that feels good.
he never actually poured the glass of milk.	Nah, you had a good run.
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.	Don't sell yourself short.
No, I don't know who was doing that.	So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
Here you go.	Maybe I should ask her out?
She is a good waitress.	That's true.
You're going to the Tony's?	Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
Why didn't you ask me?	They're musicians.
Severance package.	They did it for three years.
I'm really going to do something with these three months.	Like what?
I'm gonna read a book.	I've always wanted to do that.
I'm gonna play frolf.	You mean golf?
It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.	Like this?
Yes, exactly.	That's so strange.
Right.	Oh, what about 'ladies night'?
That is so stupid.	Reer.
Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on.	Boy, your really packing it all in.
Jerry, my vacation just started.	Like what?
Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?	Stomach ache?
I drank too much water in the shower.	Aah, top of the fridge.
Roger that.	Where are you sitting?
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up.	What academy?
Hi!	Hi!
Nice tuxedo.	Thanks, it's a breakaway.
Should we go?	Absolutely.
Hey, how you doing?	Ok.
Have a good time.	Thanks, Lyle.
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.	So, you and Lyle are roommates?
No.	Gay?
What?	Is he gay?
No.	Are you sure?
I think I would know.	This is a new one.
She had a dude?	Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
How do you know it was her dude?	What do you think it could've been just some dude?
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.	I reckon.
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's.	Dude!
All right, that's enough.	It's 1030 in the morning?
I tell you I'm wiped.	So, has the summer of George already started or are you still decomposing?
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.	You didn't give that thing back?
Jerry, it was a whirlwind.	That's because you didn't win.
Featuring the mindblowing performance of Ms.	You haven't even seen it.
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it.	Hi!
Sorry, I'm running late.	No rush.
Hey, Jerry!	I have absolutely no idea.
Who's that?	It's Kramer.
Hey Kramer.	George says hi.
How's that Tony?	Why don't you just come over?
Why can't we do this on the phone?	He's looking on to fridgerator.
Kramer.	I can't do this.
So, what's George doing?	He's not doing anything.
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's.	Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?
The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.	Oh, hello.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much.	All right, all right.
All right, all right.	I said no!
Jerry, I just want to let you know Lyle and I are completely over.	Just me?
What you think?	I can start right away.
I can start right away.	But not here.
Oh, no please Mr.	I can't believe how much we did this afternoon.
Now, what time are you picking me up tonight?	Eh, what?
You got our reservation from Sfuzi's, didn't you?	Oh yeah, Sfuzi?
Should I ware the outfit I bought today?	Sure.
Which one?	The one with the.
If I wanna get my hair cut I've gotta go now.	Ok, ok.
Do you mind?	No, I'll crab it.
Hey, I've done that today.	What, did you lose your remote?
Nah, the cable's out.	It's Lanette!
Relationship intern.	Not.
No, no.	No, because that's.
Exactly!	I'm trying.
I've tried.	Then each of us would only have be like a half man.
No, we want you to fire her.	Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
Because they're terrified of her.	She seems very nice.
Jerry, you're not in show business.	I'm in show business.
Oh, come on!	I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.	Did you tell Peterman about this?
Tttt.	You got the tickets?
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas .	I like it.
She doesn't like.	What?
A little notice would've helped!	35, and George, on the invitations.
Right on time, I like that.	I like your nails, that is a great color.
Love the sweater.	This old thing?
Ok, come on.	Ok, let's towel it up.
Jerry, where are those invitations you were supposed to get?	But we're in towels.
Jerry.	all right.
Hello.	George, where are those invitations?
Did you shave your chest hair?	No.
Yeah, the super glossy.	Ok, get them over here pronto.
It's a joke.	All right, that's not bad.
So how's George?	I don't know.
Tony.	What happened to you?
Raquel Welch!	Yikes.
Yikes.	What happened to you?
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street.	Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
I slipped on the invitations.	Back on the rack.
With the two of us?	I think we're still a man short.
All right, well.	Yeah.
What is Holland?	What do you mean, 'what is it?
No, that's the Netherlands.	Holland is the Netherlands.
Then who are the Dutch?	You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
I know, I hate it too.	I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
Well why didn't we?	Because you said this would be better.
What if we grew muttonchops?	No.
Buzz cuts?	Stop it, George.
Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?	No more crutches, that must be a relief.
Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.	Not with a cane?
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story.	That is a sad story.
Alright, we're back in!	We?
Thank you, thank you,  Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there?	Killed?
Killed.	Yeah, killed.
And you're the shark?	Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.	Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
You got any shredded coconut?	Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
Oh my God.	What?
I got a job interview.	So what's this job?
Oh, it's beautiful.	Knicks?
Playground equipment.	Welcome back to the show.
Yeah, this is better.	No.
Dddd.	What kind do you use?
Whatever you get.	Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.	Remember David Puddy?
Oh, the facepainting auto mechanic.	Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
Hey, what are you doing?	Oh, I'm taking this lace out.
Did you see Bania's set last night?	He killed.
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit.	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
What?	Do I have to ask?
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours.	Why are you buttering your face?
I'm shaving with it.	Oh Moses smell the roses.
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream.	No.
Feel it.	I don't want to.
Feel it.	That is close.
Yeah, what the hell.	You got the job?
Jerry, it's fantastic.	Hold on, they think you're handicapped?
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane.	How can you do this?
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped.	He drove a car with no arms?
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true.	Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?	You can eat it?
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.	Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.
Who?	The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
Don't worry, Kenny.	I don't believe this.
You miss her, don't you?	No!
That's my apple juice.	Someone's cooking.
Hello, Jerry.	Hello, Newman.
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?	I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
Damn you Seinfeld.	No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter  Oh no!
Let's make out.	Kramer!
Oh, man.	Look at your skin.
I'm fried.	Technically, you're sauted.
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.	Is that what the doctor said?
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine.	Yea.
Hmm.	Kind of.
No, I fake limp on my right.	What happened?
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and.	You know what's good for that?
You know what's good for that?	Hello?
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.	Oh, like what, Ovaltine?
That's true, that always happens to me.	You think that's funny?
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.	You like Bania's act.
Maybe I am.	Oh, I'm gonna puke.
Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.	You mugged Stephen Hawking?
Jerry.	Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?
Please don't shout.	Who's that?
It's Vegetable Lasagna.	Who?
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!	Get me some duty free Kahlua.
How's the trip?	Sounded good.
Well.	Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?	That's right, and I'll tell you what.
What are you talking about?	That's right, I'm taking a dive.
You're throwing the set?	I'm laying down!
Listen Jerry.	We're four months apart.
Jerry, what are you doing?	That's right, Choochie.
Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld!	If you'll excuse me.
Whoa, man!	Hey everybody!
Hey everybody!	What's the deal with lampshades?
What's the deal with lampshades?	And what's with people getting sick?
Hee hee!	I mean, what's the deal with cancer?
Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?	What are you talking about?
No, you had some good stuff.	Like who?
Well, that guy who yelled out.	He had cancer!
And laughter is the best medicine.	Hey, sorry Kenny.
What is this, parsley?	Ah, the sweet stench of failure.
Hey Jerry, didja see it?	Ouch.
Kenny!	What?
How about that Jerry?	Oh, I'm gonna puke.
Why not?	But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
Whats that?	Oh, its just this stupid thing.
Well, Im sure its stupid.	Noooo.
Tell me!	All right.
How is it talking?	Well, her belly button is like a mouth.
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.	Hey, look whose here  Puddy.
My Puddy?	And yet he continues to live.
Great.	Well, thats it.
What?	The bump into.
David and I will not be getting back together.	Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine.
What about you?	Thats different.
You want to bet?	Stakes?
Witness.	Done.
So Ill call you tonight?	Yeah.
So, youre insane?	Oh yes, quite.
Hello!	Of course its a sliding scale.
Helloooo!	La la la.
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.	Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building?
Of course its a good idea, its my idea.	Which part?
You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens.	No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
No, notime!	I can ball park it.
Here we go now she comes in.	Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
I went out with a  a friend.	George?
No, nono.	Well, I was here, thats everyone .
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.	Your hair, its somewhat depoofed.
Its the new look.	Wait a second, whats going on here?
Hoochie moochie.	Hand it over.
No!	Then what do you call it?
It was no big deal OK?	Ah, dinner!
Ugh!	Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner thats heavy.
So thats the bedroom.	And you are?
Hes a go getter!	Whos he?
My intern from NYU.	Alright.
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.	I know!
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.	Actually, that is not a bad idea.
yeah.	Now, its time to go.
Helloooo.	Helloooo.
Siege mentality, Jerry.	So, are you going to leave?
Oh no!	I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
Im a weed in Hitlers bunker.	Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff.
Hi, this is Darren from Kramers office.	Really?
In 10 minutes.	No, I dont.
Hey!	Hey!
No money, I am Puddy free.	Oh yeah, hold on.
Oh yeah, hold on.	Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office.
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office.	Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
Well, Play Now is through playing.	Do you have to write all this stuff down.
Well, Mr.	So, how hot did it get?
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours.	I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
Helloooo Kramer!	Welllcome!
And I still say hes naked under there!	Oh that makes a lot of sense.
Whats so funny?	Oh, nothing.
What are you laughing about?	Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid.
So is it fun humiliating me?	No, its not you.
Mr.	Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here.
Oh yeah sure, sure.	GET OUT!
Im leaving too.	No body said youre fat.
He is fat!	No, hes just a little bloated.
Goodbye!	Its mostly water weight.
Yeah, well nothing before noon.	Line two?
No, Im fine.	Never?
Never.	What about if youre not around?
No!	So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
Thats right.	I can do that.
So whats your decision?	I dont know.
JerryHI.	Helloooo.
You broke up with her?	So we could do the voice.
I think Im getting tired of it.	No, it can do anything.
I think I like the girl better than the voice.	Really?
Really?	Helloooo.
Alright, here you go, choke on it .	See, never bet against the backslide.
Yeah, well not for long.	No, I dont think so.
Double or nothing.	Done.
Witness?	Youre in there again.
Alright, Im out of here.	What is this?
I dont know.	Yeah.
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.	Goodbye Kramer.
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something.	Really?
Hey.	Trouble down at the plant?
No.	I understand .
So, how did it end?	They got away.
Did you bring the video camera?	Yeah, I put a six hour tape in.
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry.	I cant.
You gave up the voice?	Yeah, I thought it was stupid.
No.	Darren?
Sorry Mr.	Uh, bathroom.
Hey, use mine.	I thought it was open to the public.
I uh, took care of that.	Wow!
So, check out my view.	Wow!
Hey, theres Kramer  Darren.	Theres the giant ball of oil.
Bombs away .	This is going to be a shame.
Yeah.	What ever happened to Darren?
La la la.	Im just so glad its back.
Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.	What?
Are you mad at me?	No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
You know.	I get peeved.
Mad.	Miffed.
Mad.	Irked?
Why does she want you to be mad?	She says I suppress my emotions.
So what do you care what she thinks.	Good body.
She probably gets that impression because you're cool.	But I get upset, I've yelled.
Hey.	Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food.
I told ya.	Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
Where are they goin'?	Fix a screen door in Queens.
That's funny.	Not goin' to the Knick game.
I need someone to go with me to Mr.	You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering.
Yes, I do.	Damn it, they gave me cream!
I think they have 1 over there.	1?
OK, Jerry, enough.	You're damn right you're not buying it!
You shouldn't have to try.	I'm open.
Sarcastically Uh huh.	Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
I think you are.	Well, I'm not.
Yes, you are, liar.	Oh, stop it.
OK, liar.	That's enough!
Ooh, that was good.	Really?
I'm a man!	Tongue?
Wow!	Well this kid's not just a man.
And I think he's been telling his friends.	Hello?
Where did that come from?	Patty showed me how to get mad.
No.	Good.
All right, relax, tough guy.	What?
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door.	What do you need it for?
What is this?	Anytown, U.
Hello, neighbor.	Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
Oh, you gotta mulch.	You barbecuing tonight?
Right after the fireworks.	So, where do you want to eat tonight?
How about La Caridad again?	Again!
Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon.	Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
Maybe I should just leave.	'Maybe'!
Goodbye!	Double goodbye!
Did you and Patty just break up?	Yeah!
Well, then you're free tonight.	That's the last thing she said to me.
Whoa.	It's Patty.
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.	Whatwhat is this salty discharge?
Oh my God.	This is horrible!
This is horrible!	Patty won't call me back.
She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?	I don't know what's happening to me.
Simple.	That was the mother on Bewitched.
Are you still down in the dumps?	You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up.	Porn quotes.
What?	I love you, George.
II'm already here.	Go wherever you want.
Look what they did.	Hose under my sink.
Only if you buy.	I love you, Costanza.
Oy vey!	What happened to you, pal?
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids.	Are you all right?
Oh, no.	So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?
Well.	Sit down, Elaine.
Oh, no.	I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
Do you have an apple or anything?	Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
Or a nectarine?	Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning.
Why am I in such a fruit mood?	When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
What?	Elaine.
Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun!	I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.	Elaine?
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.	Lippman?
Yeah, and him too.	Can I help you?
Serenity now.	What happened here, Kramer?
Serenity now, serenity now.	Kramer!
Geez!	You don't look well.
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world uh!	Oh, I'm sorry.
George, you listen to me.	He's incorrigible.
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.	George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done.
So, that's it.	Yikes.
Where you going?	I think you scared me straight.
All right, Jerome, I'm in.	What?
Maybe we should get married.	I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
What?	He doesn't work here anymore.
I love you, Jerry.	Right back at ya, Slick.
No you're not!	Are you sure you can't stay longer?
Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.	He was 96 years old.
And every morning I eat a plum.	Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.	Really?
See you downstairs with the car.	Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
No no, the luggage is on the program.	Did you give blood?
No, not giving.	In case of what?
Jerry, I know myself.	Are we finished?
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?	Who wants to responsible?
I couldn't raise a kid?	What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.	What?
Oh, pudding!	Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little.
What are you kidding?	Elaine, what do you think?
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters?	Didn't go for it, huh?
No.	So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know?	Natural?
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl.	Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
Well, I guess these would be out of the question.	What the hell is that?
Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.	Oh, why?
I closed down my account at the blood bank.	What, it.
Right across the hall.	No I don't!
Hey, working out?	You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
What the heck is going on here?	Sorry buddy, clean house.
Vivian left me a message.	Is this about me?
No.	Oh, then I lost interest.
Hi Jimmy.	Hey, what are you doing here?
There was an incident.	Oh no, where's the blood?
Would you stop it.	What is this?
It's JellO.	What about this?
This is tomato juice, look.	Ooh, you're sick!
Will you calm down.	Hey, what's going on?
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles.	Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore.
Heads up!	Aaah.
Oh yeah, that eh.	Aah!
It's ok, Jerry.	I can see that!
That knife, it nicked your jugular.	I'll remember that.
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there.	What?
Three pints of Kramer's blood?	I can feel his blood inside of me.
Well, so much for purification week.	So, how's the fornicating gourmet?
Doing quite well, thank you.	George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
Hey.	Hey, how was babysitting?
Oh, just great.	Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a babysitting gig.	Really?
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck.	I'm not touching that thing.
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed  blood brother.	Oh, no.
What?	Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
So, my blood is not enough.	All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
No no no, I don't have time right now.	Hello?
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.	Kramer called you?
He calls every week.	Yes, I'm fine.
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself.	I don't need a personal trainer.
Plum.	Why are you calling my parents?
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to.	Why here?
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on CSpan.	Ok.
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?	Fine.
Ok!	No no no no no no no no no no!
Blood!	All right.
Hello, dough boy.	Mr.
All right, but I'm running out of purses here.	Ok Mr.
Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.	Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
Not funny, over your head with it.	For what?
All aboard in the pain train!	How many session did my parents paid for?
Manana.	What is this?
We're making sausages.	I thought you were gonna watch a video.
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.	Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
All right, all right.	Blood over there, sausages over here.
Tonight I want you to sleep on this.	No they're not mine Mr.
Don't lie to me, butter bean.	So, the free love buffet is over?
I got greedy.	Yeah, that's what you did.
Yeah, that's what you did.	What's going on?
I think you're right.	No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
These fries are really really good.	All right, that's enough of that.
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.	Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
Why did you get rid of that sausage?	It wasn't me, it was Mr.
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer.	What's wrong with yours?
I got no AC and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.	All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
Vivian!	Is this really necessary?
If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.	What if I can't keep up?
Move it, move it!	What's going on?
There's something wrong with your car.	Oh my God, the blood!
So how long did they drag you?	Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
Ouch!	What's the kid doing here?
I'm babysitting!	Oh, that's a drag.
That kid.	You put blood in the car?
Jerry, it was overheating.	Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
You didn't get the blood from me.	Then who?
Hello Jerry.	Aaaaahhh.
Aaaaahhh.	Yeah.
Chinese food!	Oh!
Who was it?	I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
What about your old car?	No, the engine clotted.
Fragile Frankie Merman?	Why?
Every summer you guys went to camp together.	He was not the summer you.
I made him up.	So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
No.	Too bad.
Well.	'Pottery Barn'?
Mira Sorvino.	Why don't you just throw 'em out?
Oh, no.	Can I have one?
I can't.	So call now.
I gotta prep.	That's him.
Is he still nuts?	What do you think?
Hey, you like sending out catalogs!	So, maybe they had Chinese food?
After dark?	Well, there's one way to check.
Hey, hey, hey!	It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?
Nothing.	So, this is beautiful.
Will you look at this?	Stop the mail?
Jerry!	Hey, Frankie!
This is it.	Inside the van?
It is the van!	We were ten.
Come on.	I don't want a van.
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.	You don't understand.
Well, I have an idea.	Always helpful.
Nice captain's chairs, huh?	Aye, aye.
Oh, there's a spot.	Hold on.
No, that's us.	Great.
You don't like the van?	No, no, no.
I gotta go to the park.	No!
Check it out.	Where'd you get the bricks?
Jerry, the whole building is brick.	So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey?
A dealer?	I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.	OK.
All right!	I don't want to trade.
No, you don't have to.	Hey, you know what?
They don't want to see me anymore!	But this is what you've always wanted.
It is.	Aw, that's kind of sweet.
Ah, shut up, Jerry.	Oh, no.
You remember my cousin Rhisa?	Mother of God.
One little wink.	That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me.
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me.	That is the guy!
Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?	No, she thinks she's in love with him.
That's pretty pathetic.	I know.
Uh.	Hey, have fun at the.
Isn't he the best?	Yeah, nobody beats him.
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine.	Right, quiet dignity.
Oh, no.	Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.	Hello?
So, how come you're selling it?	You know why I'm selling it.
How many miles?	Two.
City or highway?	Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
Hey, hey.	All right, just get out of here.
All right, look.	OK, fine.
Well, I don't really have any money.	You put that in!
And I'm glad I did.	You want to trade me an undershirt?
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt.	That's disgusting.
Yeah, nice to meet you.	She's into it?
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.	So have your parents found out about it?
She wants to keep it quiet.	Brave new world, alright.
Hey, you guys.	Hey, how's the antimail campaign going?
Oh, it's fantastic.	It's Sunday.
Then.	Hey, I want my van keys back.
Oh, well.	Are you insane?
Oh, listen, Jerry.	Oh, no, not Frankie.
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.	Oh, no, the woods!
Hey!	Frankie!
My name is Edgar.	Have a nice night.
Oh.	Frankie.
You hate the van.	But I'm keeping it.
So, can we go for a ride?	Yeah, let's just get out of here.
Tell the world my story.	Hey, George!
Jerry!	What?
The winter me.	You must be George's cousin.
Girlfriend.	All right.
What is that?	Don't go aknockin'.
Now you gotta sell this van.	Oh, yeah.
Oh.	I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
Well whats the difference  Come on   were like Cain and Able.	Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.
No he didnt.	Oh, no.
All right then, what was it?	Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field.
Yeah.	I knew it.
I knew it.	Why were you making gravel?
No, no, no, no.	Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
Look at this.	Come on, Kramer, get out of there.
So uh where we eating?	And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
You're making this up.	Wow!
Oh yeah the toys.	Where did you get all these?
My dad was a collector.	Super bowl!
Jerry, what are you doing?	I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
Ohhh Jerry.	I just want a, touch em a little.
You've been an enormous help.	You ran over some pigeons?
What ever they had.	Course we have a deal.
Right!	So Miranda's cooled on ya?
I'm getting nothing.	Yeah, me neither.
Really?	Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
I don't understand women.	Here comes one.
All because of this creepy new guy at work.	So he just sidles up?
That's right!	Maybe you just didn't see him.
WhaYou never see him.	Hakuna Matata?
I thought I was alone.	That doesn't make it right.
That doesn't make it right.	See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup.
Hey!	Oh my God!
It's the Merv Griffin set.	How did you get this in here?
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and  hook it.	So where you gonna sleep?
Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's  they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV.	I'm gonna get that.
What?	So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
Hm, That's interesting.	Yeah, that was me.
Oh, that's right, right, right.	An Army Pete.
Right.	He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.	You, sidle?
Well, it happened again.	What happened?
II don't get these birds!	So they're like everyone else.
Squirrel?	Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
Jerry!	I'm sorry.
No.	All right.
Well, I guess we'll just have   Ohh, just gimme that.	Uhnuhuhn  Uhnuhuhn   veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer AHa ha!
El Paso!	What's he here for?
Newman.	Actually she doesn't even know about the toys.
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?	She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
I told you he was a risk.	Oh, like he's not just carrying you!
Hmm.	So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought .
Oh.	Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
Four hours.	More heavy gravy?
Hmmhm.	Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
Jerry,  aaya  what are you doin' tomorrow?	What about my "questionable material"?
Nope, we got a whole new format.	Jim Fowler?
Hey!	TicTacs work?
You took him over to Celia's?	What?
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?	Okay, one victim.
Oh, me, me, me, me, me!	You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
Oh, don't look.	You're like eight years old.
But first, we're talking with, Jerry.	It was great!
And she doesn't know anything, about this?	No, not a thing.
Woah.	What, What is this?
Go girl!	Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
Are we getting this?	So the whole set was destroyed?
I got the nut bread, George.	So the squirrel's gonna make it?
Yeah, he's in my bed.	On the couch?
Hey.	Morning.
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.	But why?
Does that mean I have to go too?	You don't think she's just talking to me?
Hey, shut up.	You shut up.
No, I don't want this anymore.	We'll come to work with you.
And on your dates.	And shopping.
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach.	Seems reasonable.
Then I see my clothes floating out there.	Even more reasonable.
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box.	And that guy is your new boss?
Grinders, sanders, wet stones.	Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.	Neither have I.
Hey, our meat problems are solved.	Where did you get this thing?
Yeah, that's pretty good.	Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
Sara Sitarides?	Mmhu.
Oh.	What's with you?
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?	Your whole building smells like potatoes.
Yeah well, that's easy.	I think we might have one left in the stock room.
I enjoy the challenge of medicine.	Well, I have this neighbor.
A joke.	Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
No.	Cause I hit a whopper last week!
The cat.	He took out Kruger?
This slicer is indomitable.	Where did you get that butcher's coat?
Yeah, how's the doctor date?	Eh, died on the table.
Well, she's very focused.	Dermatology?
Yes, she's a dermatologist.	Saving lives?
When are you going on your next date with her?	Oh, what's the point?
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?	Revenge date?
This good be so sweet, Jerry.	Dermatologist?
Of course not!	You're right.
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated.	Flowers?
Restaurant, flowers.	Well, I'm a classy guy.
It's fine.	It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
What is with you?	You call yourself a lifesaver.
I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life.	She saved your life?
I had skin cancer.	Skin cancer!
Then you better get a camera.	He looks like a Peanuts character.
I know.	You can do that.
Without his shirt on.	You can't do that.
It seemed so disorganized.	I understand.
What about the Coast Guard?	True.
I think.	What about your sea sickness?
Maybe I could be a land guy.	I don't know if they have land guys.
Pliers?	Drawer.
Got it.	What are they for?
I.	Come again?
I forgot to ask you how did the revenge date go?	Eh, it went okay.
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?	Yeah, I started out real classy.
Yeah you did, you classed it up!	But then I found out about the skin cancer.
Oh, so it backfired?	Yeah.
Of course she treats skin cancer.	Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.
Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.	Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
And that was wrong, Jerry!	Must I?
Yes!	How does that reflect me?
Oh, well you have fun.	So again, I'm sorry.
Jerry, enough.	Was it pimple popper MD?
That's the one.	Still got it.
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.	What the hell is this?
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction.	No.
Well, what have you been doing?	Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized.
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr.	Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well.
There, there's your hives.	What, she gave me hives?
Jerry, as the Bible says Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.	She did kind of touch my face.
Jerry?	I don't know, this?
Looks like hives.	Where do you suppose that could've come from?
He is just setting the record straight.	Come on Sitarides, cop to it.
Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose?	I want the antidote, pimple popper!
That's it, I'm out of here!	Am I?
Oh, oh mama.	So, Kramer pulled it off?
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.	Well, that woman had it coming to her.
Why don't you see someone about it?	I've called everyone.
Yeah, alright.	Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
They've got everything there, Jerry.	Hey, this looks like the thing I have.
Well, that's weird.	What are you doing?
Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.	That's my hand towel!
So, somehow the Bronzo  is reacting to the poison she's giving you.	Alright, get out.
Yeah, it was olive loaf.	I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
He said he didn't care.	Yeah, I finally got to see Dr.
What did he give you for it.	Aloe.
Fine.	Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.
Yeah, I hope so.	I said I was sorry.
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!	Would you please stop saying that?
So how was the big trip?	I don't want to talk about it!
She.	'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.	I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
Not me!	George, I'm sorry.
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!	I don't know what that means.
No.	That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
Hey.	Hey.
What happened last night?	Oh, you were pretty loaded.
I know.	Oh.
Yeah.	George, we need to talk.
I think you've done a lot more than talk!	Alright, I admit it.
"That's all"?	I'm really sorry.
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!	Where'd you get that one?
Look, we are gonna settle this right now!	That doesn't punish me.
George knows that you slept with Nina.	How did he find out?
He schnapped me.	You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret!
I can't tell you.	Here, drink this.
Okay.	Pinter?
He used to be called Peter.	So?
Sue Ellen!	Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings.
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?	No, what?
Jugdish.	Yes, Jugdish.
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced?	Yes, I think it's a fine idea.
Oh, God, it's so hot!	I think it's the stench of death.
Oh boy.	This is gonna be great!
Oh, no.	Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
No.	Uhhuh.
Hello, friend.	Coach to India  The only way to go.
Good one.	You all right?
Of course I'm all right.	Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
Hey, what time is it?	You just asked me two minutes ago.
Hey, what time is it?	Ah, Im not wearing a watch.
Oh .	Yeah.
Does yours?	I'm just hanging out in this hellhole because of George.
Beauty .	Oh, come on.
Heres your plane ticket.	What are you talking about.
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India.	By flying half way around the world?
Great.	Hey  Hey Kramer, what are you doing?
Great!	HHey, Kramer, wait up.
I'm goin' to Newman's!	Great, I love Newman!
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mishmash is just gettin' worse.	Uhhuh.
I talked with the groom's parents.	Mmhmm.
So, the only reason .	Uhhuh.
Jerry?	Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice.
Oh, I should.	Sure.
Who else ya got back there?	Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation.
You slept with Nina?	Nothing.
Uh.	No good.
Don't be ridiculous.	Oh my god.
So what?	And milk.
Oh, geez.	Hello?
Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.	Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
Really?	Believe me.
I know.	I know.
Heh.	Probably the reason.
But you haven't seen.	Just go back and ask him again.
Stink eye?	Crook eye?
EVIL, eye.	Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
Oh, it's a bad day.	Everyday is my birthday.
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail.	Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
Not the point.	So you think it's a nonvite?
Ah.	Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.
What call?	He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
Oh, the great conversation girl.	I was kidding when I said that!
Told me the same thing.	Nina, Hi.
Youyou sure you never slept with her?	Hey, how 'bout my friend, George?
I'll have the Clams Casino.	Get outta here.
I think she likes me.	Sure.
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina?	Are you?
Well, what's the reason?	We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
How engrossing?	If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
Wow!	Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex.
I'm all for awkward pauses.	Why?
In any other shoe, I lose two inches.	So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
In every situation.	Oh, I'm sure it's fine.
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.	Almost.
Yeah, and a whole new me.	Really?
Jerry?	Nina?
Hi.	It's been years!
Yeah!	George, this is Nina.
And they call it the World Wide Web.	What are you, a scientist?
Ah, I gotta go.	Ah.
How as the date?	Pretty good.
Hey, hey.	What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
Oh, I need some water.	Hi, Elaine.
Oh, hey, how you doing?	Oh, hi.
Uh, no.	Oh.
Uh, you need any help, or.	No, thanks.
Ah, no, no, no.	Why not?
Oh, fantastic!	How about that.
She ate breakfast naked?	She didn't even want a napkin.
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walktothebathroom naked.	Oh, it's a scene.
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion!	I don't really have enough room.
Hi.	Hey.
'Kay.	Back together?
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.	Ah.
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.	Why now?
Ho ho ho ho!	Still with the neck hole?
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.	A cashmere sweater.
Well, it's funny.	No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
You went to the coffee shop without me?	That was an hour ago.
Showering.	Ten minutes.
So get this.	So?
So.	I think the damage is probably already done.
Yeah, you're probably right.	Mmm.
Well, here's my shower routine.	Zephyr?
Do you challenge?	No, I do not challenge.
66 points.	I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
You want some more ice tea?	Sure.
So she coughed.	Coughing.
Everything goes with naked.	When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action.
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man.	But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked.
Well, I just got out of a 27minute shower.	You got some suds over here.
Wha.	Oh, come on!
No, I mean it, man.	You promise you'll never come in here again?
Well, that's how cats do it.	But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
OK.	No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten.	That's Step Ten?
Come on, Jerry.	You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.
You got a steak?	What happened to you?
Ah, people in this city are crazy.	Here ya go.
Thanks, buddy.	What?
Yeah, a different one.	Oh!
OK, Jerry.	Oh.
I should really clean those bearings.	Please don't crouch.
Ouch!	Oh, that's bad.
You got anything to snack on?	Uhh.
Oh, pickles!	Look, please stop!
Unnnnh!	I can't.
Oh.	Well, technically he did apologize.
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch.	So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
That's right.	Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva.
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?	Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
Well.	Yeah.
Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho!	Hello?
Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!	World War I plane?
No, I'm in my shower.	When are ya gettin' out?
No, not that.	I thought naked is good.
I'm losin' it!	He took you to Rageaholics?
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!	You've got a little rage.
I know.	By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
This bread has nuts in it!	Oh, great.
Chicken wing shoulder blades.	That's it?
Well, the female body is a.	So you don't think it's attractive?
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.	So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out.
This is nice.	Yes, clothes.
Jerry?	Oh.
I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.	Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a.
So you broke up?	We couldn't carry on a conversation.
Hang on.	So what are you up to?
Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy.	Insert a knife into the center and twist.
So.	Oh, sure.
Hey!	Hey, Tim.
Oh.	You have a standard fake?
Mmhmm.	That's neat.
Hi!	Hi, I'm Jerry.
Hey.	Hey!
Great!	Didn't you call in sick yesterday?
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows.	You're gonna open your mail here?
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this.	See?
"This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance.	Oh, that's nice.
I got him Yankee's tickets!	To a children's charity!
Hey!	Hey.
Oh, nothing for me.	"Atomic Sub"?
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub.	What does that mean?
It's nothing, stop it.	When George was growing up.
Jerry, No!	His father.
No!	Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
Alright.	And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
Jerry!	And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
Oh, I can't believe it!	So?
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more!	No, you walk out.
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.	No, you wait for the movie!
I want that free sub.	You don't need the card.
No, they're not cloning sheep.	So, why don't you just try your blowoff number and see if he's called it?
Yeah, Go!	What strike?
Yeah, HH Bagels.	You?
Worked?	Bagels?
Now you know who to thank for that!	Why didn't you ever mention this?
Hey, Jerry.	Hey, Tim.
What's up?	Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
Jerry.	Gwen?
Yeah.	Really?
So, attractive one day  not attractive the next?	Have you come across this?
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome  she's a twoface.	Like the Batman villain?
If that helps you.	So, if I ask her out again  I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
Clint Eastwood!	Yeah.
Hey, check this out.	"A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund.
Made it up.	"The Human Fund.
What do you think?	It has a certain understated stupidity.
Ah, gentlemen.	How was your first day?
Oh, fantastic!	Your hands were in the dough?
Alright.	Happy Festivus!
What's Festivus?	When George was growing up.
No!	His father.
Hey!	Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
Hey.	Boy, am I glad to see you.
You were expecting someone else?	You never know.
You know, you might want to take the tunnel.	So, uh, what do you feel like eating?
I can go either way.	You're telling me.
So, she was switching?	Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
So, just bring her here.	I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop.
Lights out.	Alright, I'll give it a shot!
Office Christmas gift.	That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
I know.	Oh, that's classy.
Hey.	I there.
So, you ready to go?	Uh, why don't we stay here?
Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.	Why?
I just found a rubber band in my soup.	Oh.
Hey!	Hey, Georgie!
I think I'm just gonna go.	I'll be here.
Hey, soup.	She didn't touch it.
Ohh.	20 thousand dollars from Kruger?
I don't know.	Excuse me?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.	You want to give something back?
I'm serious.	You're going to start your own charity?
Embracing my roots.	They nailed you on the 20 G's?
Jerry!	Gwen!
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours.	Gwen.
Uhoh.	I thought you were on strike?
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?	Yeah, they have been promising that for a while.
Years.	I think Ed Begley Jr.
No.	What about Harrison Ford?
What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?	Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
The government is very touchy about us being in the air.	Yeah, right.
And the underwater bubble cities?	It's like we're living in the '50s here.
It's good suspension!	Would you stop it?
Shhh What is wrong with you?	Youre getting that vein again.
I'm starving.	It'll be twenty minutes.
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars?	I guess he graduated.
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.	Thank you.
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh?	All right.
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.	All right, were goin in.
Hold it!	George.
Hey.	Hey.
My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.	Ah.
All right, remember no rustproofing.	Au revoir, Le George.
Dont think it cant happen!	So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh?
I dont care for that term.	Oh.
No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.	I saw one once that could do sign language.
Yeah, I saw that one.	Yeah, Koko.
Hey, hey, hey!	No.
Hey, gimme a dollar.	Wheres your money?
Heh, heh, heh.	Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
The squinting?	No.
The staring?	No.
I thought all guys do that.	Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual.
Its that bad?	What do you think the Nazis were doin?
Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?	It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
People can drop change down here, Jerry.	Either that, or theyve got a weird little hangup about lying facedown in filth.
The cashier is at lunch  which is where Id like to be.	How much was under there?
I think somethin bit me.	Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player.
Ho, ho, ho!	Hey, can I have my dollar back?
Thats right.	Hey!
Lets finish this up.	Did you two break up?
That chicks whacked.	"Rustproofing"?
Yeah, thats right.	Keys?
I know about the vein!	Hey, George!
Hey, starving!	No, last one.
Jerry, I just need your signature here, and well get you that yellow car ready to go.	Yellow?
I cant give you black at that price.	George, would you help me, please?
Yes.	Sing it, sister!
does not imply transfer of ownership.	Ill be right back.
Okay.	Hey, George!
Hello?	Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer.
Who is this?	Elaine!
What?	You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.	Youre gonna get back together, anyway.
Oh, I dont know.	Come on.
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?	Fine.
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?	No.
Ill hang this phone up right now!	All right!
Ill see ya.	Bye.
Bye.	Everybodys ripping me off!
David.	Okay.
Right.	Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
Good point.	All right.
Theres a mental hospital right near here.	All right.
I can live with that.	So, youre back together?
Yeah.	All right, all right.
Oh, we dont even know what it is.	So, Im gettin the insiders deal?
You couldnt just give him one highfive?	And where does it end?
So, George, I still dont understand  how was that a setup?	And who were you tryin to set up, anyway?
What was that?	I think theres a mental hospital near here.
Ow!	So, Puddy wear's a man fur?
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.	And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
We never dated in winter.	You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
An apartmentwarming gift?	Kramer said it's a perfect gift.
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's.	Cheapness is not a sense.
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties.	I had a great time at the last one.
Hey.	Hey.
You got any pliers?	What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.	But then anyone can just look in and see you.
I'm sorry I can't stay for the.	Hey, George.
Wallet.	What?
Nobody carries wallets anymore.	That's a five.
Hey, look at this.	Except the store's in Delaware.
I'll have 'em overnight it.	Maybe cheapness is a sense.
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable.	Why?
Because important things go in a case.	But look at this thing.
I need everything in there.	Irish money?
I might go there.	Show this card at any participating Orlandoarea Exxon station.
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.	George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
A man carries a wallet.	You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
Hey, Jerry.	Hey, Joe Mayo.
Thanks.	Music?
Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?	But I could do that and the music.
Oh, no, don't worry about the music.	I was ready to get jiggy with it.
Hey.	Hey, Elaine.
Hey.	So, Elaine, notice anything different about my.
No, I don't have it yet.	So, we're givin' him nothing?
No, I brought a picture of the chair.	Did you at least get him a card?
Sure thing, Joe Mayo.	Hi, I'm Jerry.
Nice.	It's working.
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.	Because you threw it out.
No, because I was in charge of the coats.	But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
But he doesn't know that.	But that's you.
Well, I'm satisfied.	Of course.
There, there I'm fine.	What was that?
Ready to go?	All set.
You don't go that often?	No, because it's so stupid.
Do me a favor.	Compact, lipstick, all this?
And can you help to carry my keys?	What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
And a tin of altoids.	Ow!
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff.	You don't understand.
You know what?	Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
No.	I'm not carrying a purse.
It's not a purse.	Oh.
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?	I don't know.
Yeah?	Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Not yet.	What?
Did he get it?	No.
What, she's out?	Well, so what?
Allllll right!	What is that noise?
That's my toaster.	You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
88th Street?	What was that pop sound?
Nice carryall.	It's European.
Do you still have my lipstick?	Uh, yeah, I think I do.
My job was to keep you away from the music.	What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
Guess not.	You should've been there last year.
Yeah, something like that.	I have to do what?
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.	I'm not wearing the fur.
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.	Is that right?
Oh, come on, man!	That's my walkman!
And you'll get it back.	All right.
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.	George, did you get that chair yet?
It gets here when it gets here.	You know what?
Excuse me?	Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music.
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?	No, you don't have to buy anything.
I already bought it!	I don't understand.
I needed it!	Because of your giant wallet.
Never!	Your good friend is morbidly obese.
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.	It's not a purse.
All right, Silvio's down there.	All right.
There you go.	How do I look?
My receipts!	Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
That is your coat?	It sure is.
Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.	That's true.
Jerry, you forgot your purse.	Oh, thanks.
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse.	Maybe this isn't my coat.
Jerry, where'd you get it?	No, it's not.
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.	Hey!
Your what?	The.
You mean a purse?	Yes, a purse.
Yes, a purse.	So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.	He should have had a reverse peephole.
Hey, Babe.	Hello?
All signs point to 'Yes!	So your saying UNICEF is a scam?
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation .	Oh!
Oh!	No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate she moved to New York a few years ago .
Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!	Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation.
Euh.	She should just give up.
She should just give up.	Heeyyy!
Why don't you just give up?	Kramer!
At least that's what Jerry says.	So.
I think she was happy someone finally said it.	Why'd you have to say anything to her?
'felt that the conversation was lagging.	Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up .	What did you wanna be?
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this.	I don't either.
Come on, We're two intelligent people here.	It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
try shaking it.	You've been hiding her from us.
Jerry, She looks exactly like you.	She does not.
Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.	Hey!
hey!	What!
Well that's not how she remembers it.	Well, I got to talk her out of this.
She does stink and she should quit.	Yeah.
Aahh.	George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.	What are you doing?
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.	Yeah!
Well, I think one of us should leave.	Sally, you can't quit the business.
Hehumm!	You can't give up.
Really?	Of course, I stink, you stink.
Yeah!	All right, I think we've covered my act.
Right!	NOW!
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon.	Oh!
What does that mean?	Yeah.
Enjoy.	Elaine huh?
Oh!	No.
Why would I.	It's ludicrous.
Yes.	For either one of us.
No.	So.
Exactly.	I'm not gay.
Where's the crazy man, Come on up.	Come on in here.
Haaaaaa!	What's happening?
I've made an important life decision.	Lets talk about that.
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do.	Yeah right.
Silence YES!	Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is nonverbal.	Well what does this mean?
That's the idea.	Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
Oh!	Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a Onewoman show?
No, no.	Ah!
Ah!	Aw.
Hi everybody think you're really going to like this 'cos it' about me.	Oh!
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .	Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from .	The New Yorker?
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon .	Wow!
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.	Nodding off.
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.	Where did you see that?
Jerry, sorry I'm late.	No,no I tought the show was terrific.
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH!	What a surprise.
Well boys, I did it.	I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
That is not the point.	some mouthwash, a hat, something.
Just read it!	Pretty good.
Pretty good?	It's a pig at a complain department.
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha.	I get it.
Do you!	How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
Everything with you has to be so .	I'm a comedian.
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice.	Well I got a complaint.
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker.	oh!
The pig says "my wife is a slut.	Now that's a complaint.
To cease and desist on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld.	How could she say that on TV?
George is in big trouble.	You ripped off a Ziggy?
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets.	I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.
Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me.	That's right sister.
Oh and speaking of issues .	I thought you stopped talking?
Yes.	And you don't.
Nooo.	So.
Exactly.	Hmmmm.
We.	No, no.
She said no.	What did you do?
What could I do?	George, both parties don't have to consent to a breakup.
Well, I don't really like her.	That's good.
I don't find her attractive.	Solid.
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.	Always popular.
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr.	You have an airtight case!
I'm afraid we're out of time.	Hey.
What?	Check these out.
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.	No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week.
You already have an in.	Oh, that'll intrigue him.
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.	George Peppard has been dead for years.
Oh  That'll do!	What about Puddy?
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks.	So, what's this guy about?
I don't know.	Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity!
Which one is he?	Green suit, power ring.
Hey.	So you bought a cooler?
Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my.	You were in the Army?
'Literally'?	No, go ahead.
A little.	Oh, come on!
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue!	How long did you last?
Hey, what if he's married?	Kramer?
OK!	So, you would date a married guy?
You peeked!	THIS is your hiding place?
Jerry!	Elaine, what are you doin' down there?
You didn't hear me buzzing?	Oh, I guess it's broken!
Throw down your key.	It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
I'll catch it!	You'll chicken out at the last second.
Huh?	I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep.
Nodding off!	All right.
All right.	Here!
It went in the sewer!	Hey.
What are you doin'?	You jammed your key in here?
You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you?	I'm gonna go let Elaine in.
Oo, y what are you doing with her?	Kramer!
Security issue!	Oh, hey.
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy.	Oh, thanks.
That wasn't me!	So, he's definitely married, huh?
Uh.	Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.	Oh, come on!
Jerry!	George, the buzzer's broken!
George, the buzzer's broken!	I believe this belongs to you.
Heyyyy!	Where did you get that?
Thanks.	I'm sorry.
What?	There's been some robberies in the building.
Sounds like a scam.	I'm very sorry.
So, I broke up with Maura.	Great, you're lonely and miserable again.
Feels right.	Is that guy still there?
He's starin' at us.	Don't look at him.
Don't look at him.	We don't hear that.
Want a bite?	Nooo, I don't.
I think this will burn!	So you do live here.
Yeah.	You live on this floor?
Yeah.	So you live right.
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone.	Is he wretchedly poor?
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.	So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
How can I end it over money?	Well, let's think.
Yes.	Good.
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and.	Same situation.
Hey.	Hey, where have you been?
Green Lantern.	We found out his super power was lack of money.
All right.	He's invulnerable to creditors.
We get it.	He's the GotnoGreen Lantern.
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.	Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.	Really?
Did I leave my glasses here?	He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
Heh.	There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
It's Phil's.	Who?
Our neighbor that you.	What'd ya tell him that for?
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved.	He let you?
Aw, Glenn.	Hi.
Yeah, I'm here.	Phil.
And?	I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
That's my wife.	All right, I think we're done here.
This isn't going well.	I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks.
You don't need the cufflinks!	Where are you goin'?
It's a big night.	Which is with who?
Whoo!	I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
Yeah, see?	You're a lifesaver.
Fredo is dead.	That strange Portuguese guy that lives nextdoor to the incinerator?
No!	Oh, Phil.
Yeah.	Just get the key and let's get out of here.
Yeah, yeah.	Kramer!
What?	You killed Fredo!
Well, Fredo was weak and stupid!	Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird.
You just answered your own question.	Oh, no!
I guess I'm.	Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.
'Man's best friend'.	Oh, my God.
All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.	I'll dig.
Listen, I heard that Lassie 3 is buried around here.	Well, that was easy.
All right, Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace.	Hey, Kramer!
Oh, my God!	Hey, neighbor.
So, what are you gonna do?	Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
Oh.	You mean it was open?
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant pageturner?	It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad.
How much was it?	Two hundred.
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?	Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot.
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.	Susan's parents?
At the funeral, give or take.	Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes?
OK.	Still no Puddy?
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up.	What?
What black guy?	Darryl.
No, he isn't.	Isn't he, Elaine?
I thought he looked Irish.	What's his last name?
That's not Irish.	I think he's black.
No, it isn't.	Why not?
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.	If he's black.
Is he black?	Does it matter?
No, course not.	Oh, so you need to know?
Should I take that?	Uh, one second.
Oh, sure.	House in the Hamptons?
Well.	Hey.
Well, grab a cigar, boys.	Wow.
Uh, you remember my coffee table book?	With the little legs?
Oh.	How much are they payin' you?
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while.	That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while.
Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up.	From what?
From the grind.	What's that?
Rise and shine, sleepy head!	It's 530 in the morning!
We let you sleep in.	Well, as long as I'm up.
Aw, Jerry.	What does that mean?
Oooh!	Radar detector?
This looks like too much money.	Nah, I got it from a guy on the street.
You think it's hot?	Could be.
I'm right here.	And you can do everything with it.
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?	Yeah, I guess.
Hey, buddy.	Kramer, what are you doing here?
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.	Kramer, you can't live down here.
Kramer, you can't live down here.	Not you.
Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.	If you feed him, he'll never leave.
I guess.	I can't believe this.
Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.	Dad, it's got lots of other functions.
The service was slow.	Well, your tip is four dollars and thirtysix point six six six six cents.
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday.	Oh, right.
Even so, the press would bury him!	What press?
Hey, Morty.	She's fifty.
No, but.	So did you figure out Darryl's.
Ah, I've given up.	You're a master of race relations.
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?	Yeah, it's all my father's doing.
Yeah, it's all my father's doing.	He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes.
Oh, heh heh heh.	Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
I'm gettin' his mail.	Oh, no.
Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?	George, listen to me.
What about the mail?	This is far more important.
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons.	Hey, Dad.
Right.	You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
All right, look.	Wizards!
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.	Kramer.
Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!	Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.
Well, what about your deal, huh?	I didn't have a deal!
Well, don't worry about it.	Down here?
Oh, well.	Aw.
This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.	A Willard?
Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?	Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
You didn't have a deal?	No deal.
Well, the people have spoken.	Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be!	It does other things!
I had 'em, Jerry.	And then?
I lost them.	Showmanship, George.
I can't just leave.	That's the way they do it in Vegas.
You never played Vegas.	I hear things.
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?	It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
Yes, he is lazy.	Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
Yes, he is dumb.	So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back.	No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.	Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
Quiet!	Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
How long have you two been together?	I dunno.
Hey Jerry.	Hey Mickey.
A little wetter.	What's with the fake sneezing?
They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms.	Do medical schools actually do this?
HUAAHHH!	I think the phone is ringing.
HUAAHHH!	Would you hold it a second?
Mickey, DTs.	Hello?
Hey.	Elaine?
No, it's me.	George?
Jerry, it's Sophie.	Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking.
You got any Ipecac?	Ipecac?
No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.	Did he overdose?
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.	What did you do the rest of the day?
I saw "Titanic".	And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?	No.
I think it's neat.	I hear things.
"It's me?	I thought so.
They?	No, no.
What was that?	Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
See, showmanship.	Yes!
Gonorrhea!	One message.
"Hey Jerry, it's me.	Sophie.
She's still doing that?	Yep.
Alright, I'll tell you what you do.	I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
What the hell is a gander, anyway?	It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it.
Hey Raef.	She thinks it's someone named Raef.
Good, let her think it.	So, what's going on?
Ask about you, ask about you.	So, uh, how are things with Jerry?
Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor story.	Right, right, the tractor story.
Are you sick, Raef?	I sound funny?
Abort!	Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye.
That was very real.	She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Woah, back it up, back it up.	Beep, beep, beep?
You know what I think?	No one's stealing a tractor, it's a fivemileanhour getaway.
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?	No, she looks completely normal.
Oh.	You think she's got toes for thumbs?
How's her handshake?	I don't know.
Hands a little smelly?	Why do I seek your counsel?
Well I'm going to hell.	That seems about right.
I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.	What do you care?
I know, but he does.	So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
Well, relationships are very important to me.	Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
I move my knight.	They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore.
Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?	Losing?
Bought the farm?	Tractor!
This is an odd side of you, Jerry.	Wait, don't go.
A scar?	A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a.
A tractor.	I'm sure she's a little selfconscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
I don't see why's she more selfconscious about that than her toe thumbs.	She doesn't have toe thumbs.
Huhho!	Never.
You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about.	Sophie, it's me.
How could you know?	Shh.
Well, I'm sorry.	Hey, hey!
Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner.	You got gonorrhea from a tractor?
But I did.	Alright, that's it for me.
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.	First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh?	You better hurry.
Oh, boy, look at this.	Yes.
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong.	She's at that annual Peterman party tonight.
No, that wasn't dancing.	Hey, there's Leo.
Oh?	Uncle Leo.
Oh, yeah.	Did I just see that?
They made me buy it.	Yeah.
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.	'French Impressionist Paintings'?
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.	I can't.
Alright, Leo!	Sleeping in the caragain?
Cocktail flu.	Oh, right.
Worse.	Ah, the drunken makeout.
Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?	What's your position?
Ohh.	As opposed to a spirited bout of SkankoRoman wrestling.
Jerry, check this out.	No, you're not.
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office.	No, he doesn't.
He's shipping us a rickshaw.	Yes, it can.
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.	So, who's gonna pull this thing?
Dadadada no.	My, isn't this an awkward moment?
They're always walkin' around the city.	Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
Jerry, hello!	So, Leo, how's everything?
I still have the ringing in the ears.	Yeah, yeah.
What, are you kidding?	Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
Why didn't ya say hello?	Because you were too busy stealing a book.
You still say hello.	Leo, I saw you steal.
Oh, they don't care.	Who, criminals?
Senior citizens.	You could get arrested.
Arrested?	Leo.
Alright, alright.	Thank you.
Well, you just lost a lot of business!	I don't believe this!
Mmhmm.	He's over there in the overcoat.
We have a 5150 in paperbacks.	'5150'?
You're under arrest.	I just wanted you to scare him.
Jerry, you ratted me out?	Hello?
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.	Prison.
She's got priors.	Prior convictions?
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.	What does that mean?
Nobody pays for everyting.	You're stealing too?
Nothing.	Mom, you too?
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.	Alright, I'll talk to you later.
We gotta find that rickshaw.	To the Idiotmobile!
That is correct.	Tina Turner?
Well, I've to every Brentano's.	Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
I don't understand what the big deal is.	Not underpants.
Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.	Uncle Leo.
Jerry.	Uncle Leo, I'm sorry.
You mean my crime of passion?	Uncle Leo, wait!
You know, I could let it go for.	Leo's furious.
Jerry, simmer down.	I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
Simmer!	That book has been on a wild ride.
May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?	I don't read in the bathroom.
Jerry.	Hello?
Hey, it's me.	Uncle Leo?
Oh, that's nice.	Nightmares.
Eat your soup!	You're not feeding him, are you?
Hey, buddy.	Ah!
I thought I heard you.	Get out of here!
Kramer?	Will everybody please leave?
It's entirely possible.	I want everyone out!
Good night.	Good night, Newman.
Great.	So, the worst is over?
Yeah.	Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
See ya.	I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
I can't sell the book.	It certainly has.
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it.	You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back  and to you that's even?
Did you want to speak with the manager?	Yes.
Yes, Uncle Leo.	Oh, come on.
That's right.	So it could be anyone?
I.	That guy!
For he's a jolly good fellow.	What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
It is the forced socializing.	Why aren't you there now?
I had to take a sick day.	You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours.
Your old high school hangout?	They're closing.
Uhuhuh.	Where did you get this?
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.	You sure have a lot of friends.
I'm gonna eat that later.	So they just gave you this?
Oh, it's no big deal.	How come I haven't read about this?
Uh, Headso.	Son of dad?
No.	We used to come in every day.
Oh, thanks.	All right, make it the large sodas.
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger?	Yeah.
Ah, beat it, punk.	Hey, look at the high score"G.
Yes!	I remember that night.
Here's your pizza pea brains.	I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
End under water?	Be that long.
So much more violent.	Not as long.
Yeah.	Well, it was nice meeting you.
What you were thinking.	Right.
Oh!	Sure.
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry.	Fabulous.
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?	Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
What?	Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park.	Oh, come on.
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages.	Another friend?
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck.	Come on.
Dnggagnggawt.	Hello?
So how's it going with my friend?	She's a sentence finisher.
She's a sentence finisher.	What is that?
Oh, it's a cake party.	So join in.
I can't.	All right.
Lovely evening.	Really bad meal.
Go for a hansom cab ride?	Call it a night.
84th street, right off Riverside Park.	Riverside Park.
So you slept with her?	She lives right off Riverside Park.
No.	How'd it taste?
A little stale.	Yeah.
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you.	Pennsylvania Dutch country?
What is going on with you two?	Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
400 sugar fix.	Well, I'm calling this off right now.
No, no.	Well, I'm not going over there.
Well, no.	Hi, Lisi.
Hi, honey.	Uh, yeah.
So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart?	Well, before we do anything.
Well, before we do anything.	Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere.
Then may I say something.	Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life.
Are you afraid to kiss me in public?	Have we even been in public?
So now you're going to tell me what I'm thinking.	You are not dumb.
You are not dumb.	These beans are pretty good.
20 minutes.	Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad.	Nice to meet ya!
Fine.	Oh, thank god.
930.	We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
Goodbye, Jerry.	Lopper.
Out!	Lopper.
Lopper.	Lisi, Lisi.
Jerry, you came for the big moment.	No.
Ha ha.	Oh.
Yeah, yeah.	Oh, I can't.
Look what I found.	Great.
Ha ha.	A long, long weekend.
Ahh!	Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
Wait a minute.	By yourself?
So do you.	Game over.
What happened to your voice?	I was screamin' at hecklers all night.
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'.	Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
The nickname.	You mean like.
But I was thinking.	But there's no "t" in your name.
There's no Gbone.	There's a gspot.
That's a myth.	Tbone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?	They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
Why did you get a maid?	You don't have to whisper.
Where did you get her?	I hired her from a service!
All done.	Thank you.
Is this mine?	Yeah.
Yeah.	What?
Come on, Jerry.	Notice what?
Oh.	She wants to be an actress.
Hey.	You have a girlfriend?
Jerry, where have you been?	At a rodeo.
Yeah.	It's like 10 minutes by subway.
What?	That's the new area code.
I don't have a fax machine.	Here we go.
Well, now what are we gonna do?	And a dead bolt.
Aah!	Well Cindy, the place looks great.
Thanks Jerry, gotta run.	Ok, I'll see ya.
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.	No.
What?	I was going to say, "Being a good host.
Ohhoho.	But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship.
So you consider this a relationship?	Yes, I do.
Oh.	Yes, we have.
Where did you go?	The store.
Mm!	Stuff.
Cleaning supplies?	And gum.
Oh.	She's not a maid.
I could've killed you, and no one would've known.	Kramer, you're still on the phone?
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together.	Really?
Jerry's teasing.	Madeline stays here.
Madeline stays here.	Hey, Tbone!
No.	No Tbone?
Hey, is that Tbone?	No!
Well, why no Tbone?	Why no Tbone?
You're sleepin' with the maid?	Yes.
I've done that.	No.
Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?	Yeah.
No, no, no.	They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
Thanks, buddy.	Where you goin'?
Huh?	Well, she's here.
Well, what's the matter?	What did I just pay for?
Uhoh.	Koko?
Koko.	Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
Yeah.	Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
Tell me about it.	No, George.
How much you pay this maid?	40.
40?	I don't know what this is.
Hey, hey, hey.	Ooh.
Well, now I can't see Jerry.	I look about the same.
What?	I was talking to him.
What?	Never mind.
Jerry, come on.	What?
Come on.	Go back.
Eh!	I said, never mind.
Yeah.	I hate the counter.
Hey.	Hey.
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building Mrs.	Oh, she didn't mind?
No.	Hey, that's great.
What happened to Mrs.	Elaine got a new number because she died.
What did he say?	Some new kind of pie.
All right, who's down there?	Hey, there's a booth.
Hey.	So how's it goin' at work?
Oh, yeah.	Double zero?
Say goodbye to Koko.	Goodbye, Koko.
Bye, Koko.	Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
What was that?	I didn't hear anything.
All right, I'm takin' off.	Oh, right!
No.	For what?
For my maid services.	But you didn't really do any work.
I made the bed.	But you took a nap in it.
So?	I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
No.	Well, who took the nap?
The girlfriend.	40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
So, what are you saying?	Ho, ho.
You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid.	So is this a breakupquitting?
Yeah.	Oh, yeah?
No.	So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead?
Hit.	Miss.
He called 6 times yesterday.	I wouldn't worry about it.
Hit.	Elaine.
Elaine.	Hello?
Hey, buddy, don't say no!	I accept.
I went down to Madeline's.	Well, what happened?
I think it's over.	What's around you?
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza.	Is it Famous Ray's?
No.	Famous Original Ray's?
It's just Original, Jerry!	Well, what street are you on?
Hey, I'm on first and first.	Just wait there.
You Steinfeld?	Yeah.
My name is Maxwell.	Cindy.
She says she had a little problem with you.	You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
Oh, yeah?	Hey, come on.
You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?	What?
911.	Nexus of the universe.
What do you want?	Here.
I don't want any money from you.	Come on.
Looking for a good time, sir?	Well, this is all very sophisticated.
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.	Right.
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those.	I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.	Keep your shirt on.
Oh, boy.	Look at this guy.
I'll tell you when you can go.	Oh, calm down, maroon Golf.
Blimp The Hindenburg Story.	How was it?
I found it morose.	Yeah.
The place went nuts.	Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
Why are we slowing down?	What is that music?
What's with all these flags?	Oh, no.
And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.	See?
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes.	I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking.
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out.	But that's a oneway street coming this way.
You know you're going to.	All right, I'm worming.
Hey, Jerry.	They're not letting me in.
My hand is out.	Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand.
This guy's giving me the stareahead.	The stareahead.
Oh!	One more lane to go.
Oh, look who's here.	Maroon Golf.
Where you goin', black Saab?	Could you move your car back a little?
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.	You can't do that.
Con dios?	Can you believe her?
Yeah.	Where are you going?
The movies.	You're going to that again?
It's a performance, Jerry.	That's not what I do.
Isn't it?	Maybe a little.
It's right in the explosion scene.	I've gotta see this game.
You want to get outta here?	Walk away?
You've got insurance.	Isn't there a deductible?
All right, what is your deductible?	I don't know.
Yes, because they've already deducted it.	From what?
The car, which we're leaving.	We're not leaving the car!
All right.	Absolutely not.
Swung on, line hard toward left center field.	I'm ready to talk.
Ok, here's the deal.	What's that?
You raise the hand, lower the head "I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Ok!
All right.	What's that on your forehead?
It's probably chocolate.	Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
All right, stop it!	See ya around maroon Golf.
What was that?	I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules!
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules!	Elaine?
Jackass?	So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this.
Buenos dias, my friend.	Not you!
Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?	Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?
Used to date?	'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
This thing can't hurt me, can it?	I don't know.
Oh, my god.	Hey, there's the soda guy.
Ho ho!	What seems to be the problem, officer?
They're for protection, Jerry.	At me?
No.	Oh.
The side?	Yeah.
All right!	Oh.
Hola, Jerry!	Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
Yeah, I know!	You were watchin'?
You were watchin'?	Oh, that was a strike!
Mr.	Not Pennypacker!
You know him?	I wish I didn't.
It's down the hall.	Oh, hello.
Art.	Mr.
Uh, Varnsen.	Pennypacker.
Pennypacker.	Vandelay.
The factory?	The Saab factory?
Jerry, that's in Sweden.	My car!
Jerry, the Mets lost.	I love a parade!
Well.	Well, what about my car?
Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.	Hey, there's Elaine.
Hey.	Well, you look, uh.
Jackass!	Somebody remember where we parked.
I can't eat this without catsup.	I know what you mean.
Do ya?	It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
Same thing!	Not really, but it's something.
You know what?	So what are you doing later?
Nah  what for?	To see a movie.
I've been to the movies.	Not this movie.
They're all the same.	Did you shower today?
Yeah.	That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry?	Oh, quit complaining.
Yeah.	What is that?
Hey!	Ey, ey!
No, thank you.	Nothing.
What?	Have a good time.
Yeah, there's something in the air today.	You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
Oh, I forgot to call Jill.	Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
What?	Faux pas.
Why?	You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone.
Onthestreet cellphone call is the lowest phone call you can make.	It's an act of total disregard.
It's dismissive.	It's pompous.
Boy  I'm really surprised at Elaine  that whole phone business  she should know better than that.	Hey  hey  hey!
What?	Where do you think this relationship is?
You're so uptight.	Uptight?
Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at NBC.	Hello.
Who's he?	He is the new president of NBC.
Our show, "Jerry"?	Right.
"Jerry", oh my God.	Yeah!
When?	Today, like right now.
Right now?	"Jerry"!
He wants to talk about "Jerry"?	He wants to talk about "Jerry"!
"Jerry"!	"Jerry"!
Can I go like this?	Sure!
No sports jacket?	Forget the sports jacket.
I won't feel like a writer.	You're not a writer.
Water.	Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.	Don't blow this.
I will not blow this.	If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.	He might not want nothing.
Something, nothing, I could care less.	He might want a show about anything and everything.
Anything, everything, something, nothing  Who the hell cares?	All right.
Magic time.	What?
How you been?	Good, good.
Kimbrough.	Don't spell.
Woo!	Shut up, George.
What do we have in the fruit department?	Oy.
We call it a watercooler show.	Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.	Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show.
It's really not accurate.	But I think Mr.
What I want to do is put it on the air.	He's a little off the wall.
And Elaine  I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.	Definitely.
Yeah!	Yeah!
Jill, hi, it's Elaine.	Hi.
Jerry, I'm on the other line.	No no  this is an emergency  get off the phone.
I'm sorry, Jill.	The "Jerry"'s back on  the TV show!
That's the emergency?	Did you hear what I said?
I was on the other line talking to Jill.	Jill?
You said it was an emergency.	So now she's lost a phone faceoff?
Jerry, you ever watch that?	Yeah, it's pretty good.
Nothing.	NBC is letting me use their private jet?
Oh hey!	Hey  how was the beach?
You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.	So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"?
You're moving to California?	Yeah, only for a while.
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit?	No, I'll be back.
So we can go anywhere we want?	Anywhere.
Why are they doing this?	I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
Oh  I got it  how about Russia?	Russia, it's so bleak.
It's not bleak  it's springtime.	It's still bleak.
You can't be bleak in spring.	You can be bleak in spring.
All right!	Alright  come on  come on now, people.
Oh yeah  oui oui.	So that's it  it's settled, we're going to Paris.
Hey.	Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out.
Hello, Jerry.	Hello, Newman.
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?	Yeah, that's right.
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there.	That's a shame.
Take me!	Oh, forget it.
Ah, Jerry?	Yeah.
I'm Captain Maddox this is my copilot, Kurt Adams.	All set.
Don't worry about that.	Just keeps on getting better and better.
Just keeps on getting better and better.	Not bad.
I'm sorry  I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.	You're complaining about a private jet?
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?	Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
This is a real piece of junk.	You're not writing any letters!
Kramer, what are you doing?	Still got water in your ear?
What is that noise?	Kramer, what the hell did you do?
What's going on?	Kramer!
Just when I was doing great.	Is this it?
Jerry?	Yeah.
There's something I have to tell you.	What?
What?	What?
The contest  I cheated.	Why?
Because I'm a cheater!	Great  I won.
Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.	Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
No no  me first.	Alright.
We're straightening out?	We're straightening out!
Well, again, sorry about that little mishap.	Where are we?
Latham, Massachusetts.	Okay.
Okay.	We'll see you later.
Well, what are we going to do about Paris?	I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
First class doesn't make it anymore.	Alright, I'll feel him out.
Nice day.	Another one?
Don't shoot.	Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
I want your wallet.	That's a shame.
Officer, he's stealing my car!	Okay, thanks anyway.
Forget it.	No, no, no.
You're under arrest.	Under arrest?
Well, they just passed it last year.	Oh, yeah.
I guess we could've called for help.	But then we would have missed the whole thing.
Yeah, he's right.	I forgot about the video.
What is that?	Plane's ready.
This is excellent huh?	You know I've had to reduce my milk level.
I bet.	It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Good morning, Jackie.	Good morning.
Do you think it's funny?	No.
Here.	This one?
That's right.	Do I have to?
Jerry, did you hear that?	Yeah.
Don't shoot.	Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Oh no.	Gimme that rye.
Stop it.	I want that rye lady.
Help  someone help.	Shut up, you old bag!
Call Marla Penny.	The virgin!
Call Donald Sanger to the stand.	Who the hell is that?
Bubble Boy?	That's right, the Bubble Boy.
What's a Bubble Boy?	He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
I don't know.	Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die  that's why.
Call Yev Kassem.	Who?
Medium turkey chili.	Medium crab bisque.
I didn't get any bread.	Just forget it.
The state calls Mr.	How did they find Babu?
And so we wait.	Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
I think so.	It's not that bright orange one is it?
Hello?	Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
I think it's going to be okay  that girl just smiled at me.	Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
Come on, Jackie.	What?
Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular.	Well, it's only a year.
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?	Sure.
Cause you only get one call.	I think that would be a very nice gesture.
I got it  it's out!	See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
Really?	Oh yeah.
Haven't we had this conversation before?	You think?
I think we have.	Yeah, maybe we have.
Yeah, maybe we have.	So what is the deal with the yard?
I am.	I'll talk slower.
Murder one.	Murder one?
Grand theft auto.	Grand theft auto  don't steal any of my jokes.
You suck  I'm gonna cut you.	Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
Alright, Seinfeld, that's it.	Alright, hey, you've been great!
